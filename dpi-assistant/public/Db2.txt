Registries 


Registries are databases that are reusable by third party entities through exposing APIs. They allow for information to be shared amongst a wider ecosystem of stakeholders, ensuring value to citizens, periodic updates by beneficiaries and more efficient operations. 


For example, the agricultural ministry may have data on farmers. If they allow certain aspects of that data (not necessarily all!) to be reused by other ministries, it can strengthen benefits provided to the sector as a whole. For example, simply exposing an API that allows a ministry to ascertain ‘Is this individual a farmer or not?’ can help them disburse social benefits with higher trust and speed to that individual without conducting their own verification. Similarly, it can allow the land ministry to check whether a particular farmer is a small land owner or a large land owner to conduct national assessments accordingly. 


This has compounding benefits for the agricultural ministry as well since on update of information, the farmers will be proactive in reflecting that information to the ministry because it feeds multiple aspects of his life acting as the single source of truth. 


The same concept extends to student registries (where information can be used for scholarships and higher education), climate asset registries (to support carbon credit counting and ESG reporting), and health provider registries (where licensed health practitioners can be discovered).
