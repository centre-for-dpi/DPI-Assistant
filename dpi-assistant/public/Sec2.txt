Create a single source of trust for farmers through a reusable Farmer ID
 BB: Functional IDs
 A verifiable Farmer ID can serve as a common identifier across multiple services—social benefits, fertilizer subsidies, land record verification, and credit profiling. This reduces duplication, improves targeting, and builds a single trusted identity for farmers. With one ID, farmers can seamlessly access multiple schemes without repeatedly proving their eligibility.
Leverage Farmer ID to streamline subsidies through an ID–account mapper
 BB: Payments
 Farmers can link their unique ID to any bank account or mobile wallet and update preferences easily. This prevents leakages, eliminates ghost beneficiaries, and ensures subsidies reach the right farmer in the account of their choice. It also creates transparency in subsidy flows, helping governments track funds in real time.
Empower farmers with digitally verifiable data
 BB: Data Sharing
 Land records, crop details, and farmer profiles can be converted into digitally signed credentials. These records lower the cost of verification, making it easier to access affordable credit, and can also prove organic or sustainable practices to tap into premium global supply chains. Over time, this builds a trusted digital footprint that strengthens farmers’ position in markets and finance.
