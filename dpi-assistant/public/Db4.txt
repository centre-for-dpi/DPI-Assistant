Data sharing 


Data is capital. And data can be catalytic particularly to the growth of developing economies. 


There are two main mechanisms to share personal data at societal scale - these don’t present an ‘either-or’ approach but rather hint at the possibilities that can be unlocked when both capabilities are present and adopted according to use cases. 


System to system based data sharing operates through real time APIs - this is useful when the data is dynamic (changes regularly and repeatedly such as financial account transactions) and when the parties who have to share that data operate in a closed circle of trust (where everyone can connect to the same system and expose APIs to each other). 


Examples include X road implementations in Estonia and globally 


User-centric data sharing works for all use cases where data is not frequently dynamic (such as IDs, certificates, records) where issuers can digitally sign the documents and any third party can independently verify the legitimacy of the documents (when presented by the holder) without connecting with the issuer. This mechanism called ‘verifiable credentials’ allows issuers to cryptographically secure documents and incorporate QR codes which when scanned reveal the legitimacy of the underlying information. They allow for scale and reuse in contexts where operators may have different (or no) systems and support hyperlocal as well as cross border use cases.
