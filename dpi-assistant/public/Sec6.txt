MSMEs
Create a reusable MSME ID to formalize small businesses
 BB: Functional IDs
 A verifiable MSME ID can help small and micro enterprises prove their business identity across multiple government and financial systems. This makes it easier to access schemes, licenses, and formal sector opportunities without repeated paperwork. Over time, it encourages voluntary registration and participation in the formal economy.
Build MSME registries for discovery and trust
 BB: Registries
 A trusted MSME registry allows buyers, suppliers, and financiers to easily discover and verify small businesses. It helps large corporates source from credible MSMEs, while also reducing fraud and duplication. Such registries can serve as a public good to improve market access for genuine enterprises.
Enable credit and market access through digitally signed business records
 BB: Data Sharing
 Invoices, tax returns, and transaction histories can be issued as digitally signed credentials for low-cost, high-trust verification. This lowers barriers for MSMEs to access working capital, insurance, and global supply chains. With verifiable digital trails, small businesses can compete on equal footing with larger firms.
