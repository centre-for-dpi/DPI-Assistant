Payments: 


Payments infrastructure broadly covers two aspects: 


P2P / P2M payments 
A DPI for Payments infrastructure builds instant, interoperable and inclusive payments systems in the country that work for individuals of different literacy, linguistic and accessibility backgrounds. 

Key design choices can include allowing individuals to transfer money on the basis of a ‘financial address’ (similar to an email address) that does not require sharing sensitive bank account information, establishing standards for interoperability between mobile wallets and financial account providers, creating standard authentication specifications that works across interfaces and separating the actual fund flow (which remains with regulated banks) from the user-experience (where fintechs can be allowed to innovate). 

In a payments DPI, individuals can transact through any device (smart phones, feature phones and even no phones through biometric authentication!), transfer money between mobile wallets and bank accounts, and operate digitally at the cost of cash (i.e. zero cost!) 

For countries that do have some wallets or a nascent fintech ecosystem, adopting an interoperable QR code specification can help mandate interoperability, ensure smaller agile players are able to build on top of foundational payment rails and that fair competition always secures user choice in the ecosystem. 

Examples include PIX in Brazil and PromptPay in Thailand
