About the DPI Wiki
In a crowded technology innovation landscape and a sometimes polarised
geopolitical climate, Digital Public Infrastructure has emerged as an unusual point of
convergence across countries. It is now well acknowledged as a powerful strategy
to drive inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Through the DPI Wiki, we've attempted to distil 15 years of practical implementation
experience and insight across countries - cutting across some of the key areas that
make up what we call the ‘DPI Approachʼ.  It is designed to be a living resource,
constantly updated with what is new and what is important. 
Weʼve tried to simplify it to the absolute minimum of what you need to know to get
started in the execution of an inclusive, interoperable, and high scale DPI in your
country – across agriculture, finance, health, education, skilling, ecommerce, and
beyond. 
To the builders and practitioners in countries tirelessly working to solve large scale
societal problems: this wiki is dedicated to you.  
We hope it can help bring you closer to your implementation goals. 
Send us your dashboards so we can celebrate with you! 
With warm wishes,

What is DPI?
The term digital public infrastructure is primarily used in two ways:
1.To describe an approach to addressing socio-economic problems at population
scale. This approach combines open technology standards with robust
governance frameworks to encourage private community innovation to address
societal scale challenges such as financial inclusion, affordable healthcare,
quality education, climate change, access to justice and beyond. 
2.To describe real-world examples of that approach as represented by well-
designed population scale infrastructure that abide by the principles of the DPI
approach. India's digital identity system 'Aadhaar' is called a DPI, the Brazil
payments system 'Pix' is called a DPI, Estonia's data-sharing platform 'X-Road'
is also called a DPI and so on.

DPI Overview
An approach that works to transform nations at scale
Digital Public Infrastructure - or DPI - is a phrase now regularly referenced by
government officials, think tanks, development institutions, nonprofits, and even
global CEOs as a transformational approach to leapfrog progress at scale.
Countries like Brazil, India, Singapore, Australia, and Thailand have all built and
scaled DPI. As with any rapidly evolving construct, every new project and
experiment around the world slightly alters what people mean when they use the
phrase. At the Centre for DPI, we'd like to put out our thinking to help countries
answer the question: what is this magic sauce that you call DPI, and how can it fast
track our national digitisation plans to create inclusive and innovative digital
economies?

To answer this question, it's useful to first look back. The DPI movement is inspired
by the open standards & specifications that created the Internet (TCP-IP, HTTP,
HTML, SMTP, etc) and mobile networks (GSM, SMS, LTE, etc) - which operated as
the original digital infrastructure of the late 20th century, triggering a burst of public
and private innovation that broke barriers and drove inclusion. Our controversial
opinion: No other tech innovation in recent memory - not the iPhone, not a laptop,
not even a computer chip - has triggered as much subsequent innovation as those
original open standards. Read that again slowly.
So looking ahead, how do countries take a similar approach that can catalyse
inclusion and innovation in their nations in areas like access to money, access to
health, access to education, and competitive innovation in services?
The DPI approach is about moving from platforms to open networks powered by
protocols. We think there are 5 foundational categories that make up 21st-century
digital public infrastructure: identifiers and registries; data sharing and AI/ML
models; trust infra; discovery and fulfilment; and payments. 
For a thriving digital economy, these are the functions that should be conveniently
accessible at low cost. And fortunately, unlike the mobile and internet, these DPI
require even less complementary hard infrastructure (wires, cables, cell towers,
etc.) to create scalable impact.

8
These categories are not intended to be mutually exclusive! Payments on some
level is a type of data sharing. Digital signatures (Trust infra) are used in
ID/Payments/Data/Discovery and beyond. Consent (Trust infra) should be used in
ID and in Data exchange. These categories are simply to indicate areas to focus on
when crafting DPI! 
Moreover, this is not an exhaustive list! These blocks are necessary but not
sufficient to achieve a thriving digital economy. It is also important to note that the
blocks can only be considered as DPI if they are build in accordance with the 
technical architecture principles - a data sharing system that is not interoperable or
a digital ID that is not minimalist or reusable cannot be considered as digital public
infrastructure. 
Examples of how these DPI blocks can supercharge interactions in society: 

9
1.Identity Verification: With an individual's consent, any entity can verify their
identity (confirming "Are you who you claim to be?") through the
eAuthentication capability. Additionally, basic information can be collected
through eKYC ("Can you provide more details about yourself?"). This process
helps reduce costs for services such as banking and insurance.
2.Payments: This system enables anyone to make digital payments to others,
including street vendors who may lack digital or financial literacy, by simply
scanning an interoperable QR code. This helps the conversion of a cash-based
economy to a digital economy. The integration of digital identity and payment
systems also allows governments to efficiently distribute social benefits without
leakages.
3.Data Sharing: It enables individuals or entities to verify the authenticity of
certificates and licenses by scanning digitally signed QR codes for high-trust,
tamper-proof personal data sharing. Furthermore, it facilitates real-time,
consent-based data sharing between systems, thereby reducing the cost of
services like lending. Data sharing also includes creation of publicly available
datasets for research & analytics available via open APIs
4.Trust Infrastructure: This allows individuals to interact and transact without
needing to be physically present or use paper, utilising digital signatures and
public key infrastructure to ensure secure transactions.
5.Discovery and Fulfilment: This allows any product or service to be discovered
and fulfilled across multiple applications, whether it's discovering a lawyer or a
telemedicine provider and booking an appointment with them, choosing a mode
of transport, or even searching and applying for scholarships. 
Many different building blocks in each of these categories can drive exponential
outcomes within and across various sectors.

10
...by creating ecosystems that combine 1) the right technology architecture;
supplemented by 2) governance frameworks that are transparent, accountable,
participatory; and 3) robust public and private market innovation.

11
In each of the sections below, we'll cover specific building blocks that fall into
these categories, and link to open blueprints/specifications your country can use
to kick off the transformation.
We've also thought through some tech architecture principles and 
implementation/execution guidance that we hope are helpful!
Let's dive in.

DPI Tech Architecture Principles
How do we distinguish regular digitisation efforts from DPI?
The five technology architecture principles above illustrate how DPI efforts can be
architected to be distinct from traditional digitisation efforts: 1) interoperability; 2) 
minimalist, reusable building blocks; 3) Diverse, inclusive innovation by the
ecosystem; 4) a preference for remaining federated and decentralised; and 5) 
security & privacy by design.
When implemented, these technical principles help DPIs achieve societal outcomes
such as inclusion, user choice, innovation, scale of delivery, speed of services,
public trust, competition in markets, and others as outlined below.

13

14
Interoperability
Driven by Open Specifications
Accelerate network effects to drive innovation and competition with technological
specifications, protocols and standards for various functions that enable
interoperability across multiple actors. Prevent silos, fragmentation of networks,
monopolisation, and walled gardens by design.
Published protocols & standards/specifications for the ecosystem to adopt and
comply with.
Choice of solutions and services for individuals
Scale of access and adoption for individuals
Competition in markets while remaining interoperable
Innovation by market players to drive differentiation of their service

Minimalist & Reusable Building Blocks
Not full solutions!
We cannot predict the future, or predict all scenarios to build a full stack, end to end
digital solution - for example, a website, portal, or app - that fully meets the needs
of a diverse and dynamic population. Unfortunately, a full solution approach
assumes just one solution will fit everyone or just one entity/institution can build for
all. 
Instead, this principle necessitates technology architects unbundle problems and
solutions to core, modular, minimalist, and reusable building blocks with open
protocols and specifications to connect them. These building blocks should create 
high trust and low costs for other public and private entities when re-used. The
ecosystem can then combine these building blocks to create many solutions fit for
purpose (akin to lego blocks). Minimalism and modularity also allows each building
block to be extensible to build or add on later as future technologies and
capabilities evolve.
This ensures simplicity of the DPI, low cost/risk of building, ease of
scalability/adoption, higher innovation around the DPI, evolvability to address future
use cases, and avoids hard-coding and building of costly monolithic full stack
solutions. 
Maximalism creates complexity, high risk, and low innovation; cannot deal with
future advancements; and most importantly drives exclusion.

Diverse, Inclusive Innovation
by the ecosystem, via open & multi-modal access
A DPI should not just be innovative in itself, but also enable diverse innovation by a
public/private ecosystem of users.
A DPIs tech architecture should allow others (public and private innovators) to build
solutions and services using the DPI at scale (akin to highways or the Internet) via
tools such as open APIs (instead of DPI providers building the entire solution in a
monolithic fashion).
Enable innovation both by ‘challengerʼ market players in the ecosystem and by 
incumbents.
A digital back-end shouldn't presuppose a single digital front-end. Enable both
the core DPI architecture and a diversity of innovative ecosystem-created solutions
to power multi-modal access: across online, semi-online (low bandwidth
connectivity), and offline modes; self-service and assisted modes; and in
smartphone/feature phone/ no-phone modes. 
•
For instance, payment systems or identity systems shouldn't presuppose just
one mode of authentication (e.g. online API based) and allow for offline or semi-
online modes (QR codes, local SDKs that can perform face authentication, etc.) 
This is essential to catalyse private innovation that doesn't merely target an elite
connected population in a country, but also innovates to solve the challenges of
diverse populations who speak multiple languages and have varying levels of digital
literacy - thus reducing the impact of a digital divide. The principle also addresses
both scale and adaptability/sustainability over time.
Overview (What to aim for)

18
Private Innovation can be leveraged both in building the DPI (for instance, in driving
private partners to enroll individuals into an identity system) and in usage of the DPI
in a wider digital economy to offer solutions (for instance, banks or private players
using an identity eKYC to offer a service like opening a bank account).
Public/private adoption and innovation should be voluntary and demand-based 
rather than mandated by authorities. This tends to create sustained usage over
time.

Federated & Decentralised by Design
Avoid centralisation. Allow for federated databases/systems where possible that are
each reusable & accessible by the individual (multiple functional identities, modes
of payments, sources of data etc.). This prevents creation of honey pots
(cybersecurity risk) and over-aggregation of information into unwieldy large central
databases (a privacy risk).
In todayʼs world, it is perfectly possible to connect various systems via common
protocols and standards and still achieve unification without centralisation. 
A lot of people think that having a central system with high security is actually
better than having multiple decentralised systems that are interconnected.
However, this has proven to be false. Simply put, any central system or storage
becomes a honeypot that is the repeated target of multiple cyber attacks.
Decentralised systems function as lower value targets and strengthened by the best
principles and practices of DPI, they become highly secure with very low chances
of large scale data leaks or privacy concerns. 
”Wrapper” APIs above disparate existing systems rather than new large
centralised databases.

Security & Privacy By Design
1.Build an architecture that operates on optimal ignorance - each system should
know as little as possible.
2.Ensure high auditability and traceability via digitally signed data, non
repudiable change logs, and authenticated transaction trails - even for
agents/employees of the hosting department(s).
3.Build and leverage participant registries (individuals, entities, things in future)
as independent building blocks to create higher trust and auditability.
4.Adopt verifiable credentials to increase trust within the system and also
enable information verifiability.
5.Enable structured, granular, and auditable consent artifacts and frameworks 
to enable sharing of personal data across systems.
6.Multiple factors of authentication/ authorisation 
Overview (What to aim for)
Technical Tools (How to achieve it)

22
Tokenisation & Masking: Tokenisation replaces sensitive data (such as an ID
number or address) with non-sensitive equivalents (tokens) and masking hides
parts of the data to reduce risk of  unauthorized access/unecessary exposure
while maintaining data usability for certain purposes.
Granular electronic consent:  A system where users can give specific, detailed
permissions for the conditions of use, sharing, and processing of their personal
data, allowing them to control which data is accessed, by whom, and for what
purposes, thereby enhancing privacy and compliance with data protection
regulations. Preferably the consent should be logged in machine readable,
digitally signed format to ensure trust.
End to end encryption: A method of data protection where information is
encrypted on the sender's end and only decrypted on the recipient's end,
ensuring that the data remains secure and unreadable to any intermediaries
(including service providers) throughout its entire transmission process.
Digital signatures: Cryptographic mechanisms used to verify the authenticity
and integrity of digital messages or documents, ensuring that the content has
not been altered/tampered with, and confirming the identity of the sender.
Verifiable credentials: Tamper-proof digital certificates issued by multiple
authorities (e.g., for identity, education, income) in machine readable formats
that use digitally signed QR codes or soft copies to ensure authenticity without
requiring centralized storage, thereby enhancing security and autonomy.
Trusted usage of the DPI by individuals and entities

DPI Implementation &
Execution Guidance
20 implementation suggestions to bring digital infrastructure in your country to life
Note: to help rapid implementation of DPI blocks in line with best practices for privacy,
security and global DPI safeguards, countries can independently reuse standardised
design and implementation artefacts curated by the international DPI ecosystem. 

24
1.Frame the problem clearly.The lack of growth of a specific digital program or
solution is not a societal problem. Identify the real and root needs of individuals
and businesses and gaps in service delivery to see where DPI can help
intervene to create exponential change..  
2.Think through why existing ecosystem players act the way they do. Mapping
current incentives and current costs is crucial to understanding how to create
change for the individual - DPI's aim is to change the calculus for ecosystem
players who can now offer better services. What will it take to get them to do
things differently? What are their real bottlenecks and costs? 
3.Donʼt aim for perfection before beginning.Universal adoption or aligning all
partners on board (especially large incumbents) is almost never possible at first.
Start anyway with a ‘coalition of the willingʼ as early adopters and build from
there - more will come over time.  Asynchronous adoption is par for the course.
Target some political support eventually, but it's not always possible to get
whole-of-government alignment at the start.
4.Donʼt leave all of the ‘howʼ to technology vendors. Think through blueprints
which include interoperability standards that create boundaries and roles for
technology partners where they can excel, rather than outsourcing all of the
design thinking to a tech partner. At a standards/blueprint level, tech is
conceptually simple and accessible for strategic or policy leaders and doesn't
require a Masters in Computer Science to take decisions on! 
5.Small improvements (+1) Thinking to drive adoption. Rather than launching
grand new projects or initiatives, ask what small (+1) changes across systems
and ideas that already exist can help convert an existing digital system to a DPI
to improve feasibility. For instance, an existing paper certificate can operate as
DPI for a digital economy with a digitally signed QR code! 
6.Small teams, high ownership. Particularly in early phases, DPI execution
typically requires small teams that drive actions across an ecosystem, rather
than unwieldy large central teams with dispersed ownership. 
7.Design for system failures: Treat power outages, misaligned incentives,
connectivity gaps, and other constraints as not the exception but as expected -
and build multi-modal options and safeguards to ensure resilience. 

25
8.Design architecture for tomorrow, but implement use cases for today based
on political will & societal demand. For instance, you should architect a
payments system that allows for multiple currencies in its root protocol even if
cross border is unlikely on day one; or you should allow for multiple modes of
authentication in a data sharing ecosystem even if one mode is the default
based on current technology.
9.Frame adoption arguments from the counterparty institution's or user's point
of view, not from the DPI builder point of view.Adoption by multiple
stakeholders with different institutional positions and interests is essential to
DPI. A market player, a regulator, a government department, or may have a
different reason to adopt a DPI building block - frame it from their goals and
interests or from an individual user's perspectives rather than yours. The value
of the DPI to their goals should be explicit and clear in your narrative.
10.Parallel rather than consecutive phasing. It is tempting to wait for one phase to
complete before beginning another - e.g waiting for ID registration to complete
before testing authentication, or waiting for registries to be completed before
building transactions/ service fulfillment networks in a sector. But if you have
minimised the components of DPI to bare essentials, build them out in parallel
as much as possible to avoid late surprises.
11.Multiple bets for the first DPI block.While implementing the first DPI block
always pick more than one, say three potential use cases and three first
adopters.  Pursue all 3 in parallel for a higher chance of successful
implementation 
12.Test and debug early.No digital project is perfect on day one. Your DPI may get
to 40-50% coverage based on high quality architecture and design, but will not
reach critical mass without consistent bug fixing, catching errors, and
continuous improvement. Seek constant market feedback on the usage of the
DPI, especially in early stages. Target early sampling, testing APIs in sandboxes,
small pilots, and hackathons as well as drive consultations with key players to
ensure iterative improvements of the approach and wide adoption at scale.

26
13.Leverage existing digital assets in the country and/or global open source
where possible. Try to reuse existing digital assets in the country - existing
certificates, databases, or systems to see how small changes could help them
operate as digital infrastructure (i.e. be reusable!) in the wider digital economy.
If you're building from scratch - the quality and availability of open source in
this space has taken a leap in the last few years -  take advantage of it to build
faster and cheaper. If you prefer to build in-house or via a vendor, ensure your
system reviews and absorbs relevant learnings from available open source
models. 
14.Impatient with actions, but patient with results. Large scale societal
transformations may take time (especially at the start, when the progress seems
invisible) before developing enough ‘escape velocityʼ to scale. Be patient while
staying determined to make the next right step.
15.Be prepared to act fast in policy windows. It is crucial to work consistently on a
DPI, build a coalition, and demo/test building blocks even when there is no
policy window or political will in sight. Only the prepared can take advantage of
an unexpected opportunity, crisis, or other policy window to drive scale-up! 
16.Don't charge on day 1:Let adoption scale before adding in an additional cost to
the user, it will reduce friction and hesitancies. Let them see the benefits of the
DPI before so that they are willing to pay for that convenience. 
17.Establish a volunteer policy: Many public-minded people will want to help in
whatever capacity they can! 
18.Early market feedback and co-creation: Organise hackathons, consultations,
etc. to gain feedback from the start. Build with the market even as you build for
the market. 
19.Don't underestimate governance: Remember, the best tech has to be
supported by strong governance frameworks from the start to nurture market
innovation and private competition in the right spirit. 
20.Minimise your role: DPI is built through humbleness! Focus on doing one thing
and do it well. Always frame the other departments / people's contribution as
more important to make them feel like a part of it and join you on the journey. 
21.Expect a rocky road: Work with challengers, and wait for incumbents. As long
as you stick to it, you will get there in the end! 

27
DPG and DPI
Are DPGs and DPI the same thing? Are DPGs necessary to build DPI? Read on to
know more!
Digital Public Goods (DPG) and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) are two distinct yet
complementary concepts. 
As described in the UN Secretary Generalʼs Roadmap for Digital Cooperation,
digital public goods are:
However, not all Digital Public Goods can be used as building blocks for DPI. 
DPI can be built through open source (or private solutions) only as long as they
adhere to open specifications, generate network effects, and trigger both public
and private innovation. 
For more information on DPGs, please visit https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/

28
DPGs having their own lifestyle and governance means that DPGs are set up by
independent institutions that can predate or outlast country specific DPI. They have
their own governing bodies and mechanisms to update their infrastructure outside
country context.  
A stack of DPGs that are interoperable and scalable can come together to build a
DPI infrastructure in countries - such as via G2P Connect for social benefit
programs.
Using open source components can help ensure that best practices are
incorporated, rapid deployment and scale is achieved, dependency or lock-ins are
avoided, and minimum efforts can unlock maximum gains. OpenG2P, OpenSPP, or
CoreMIS for government benefits or MOSIP for identity projects are examples of
DPGs used to help build DPI infrastructure in countries. 
However, DPI can equally be built without DPGs or any Open Source components
as well, though it may take a little more time, money, and expertise. Governments
can choose to build their own DPI from scratch by using proprietary software, and
private vendors - as long as they follow the principles of minimalism,
interoperability driven by shared specifications, federation, inclusion, privacy, and
security. 

29
Even if a country is using proprietary software, it should still use open
specifications. For example, regardless of the software used, it would incorporate
ISO standards for payments or G2P connect specifications for G2P service delivery
to ensure interoperability or choice for users, and avoid vendor lock-in for
institutions. 
At CDPI, we respect the autonomy of countries to choose whichever path (open
source, private, hybrid) that suits their unique needs, and work with countries that
opt for any path.
Our suggestion is that even if a country wants to build their own infrastructure from
scratch - please always review the open source components available, and ask the
private TSPs to ensure that all best practice features available in open source are
incorporated into the private systems built. Open source is a useful benchmark,
even if not used directly. This can ensure that country designers get the best of
both worlds, and keep up with the latest developments in the community. 
For suggestions on which open specifications and open source you can reuse to
build different DPI, please see here.

First use case for DPI
How should a country choose a killer use-case to get exponential scale up for a DPI
building block?
If youʼve chosen which DPI block you would want to build, congratulations! The first
step is done. Now, the second important question is, which use case do you want to
pilot that DPI in? 
For example, if you have decided to build verifiable credentials, your first use case
can be making verifiable credentials for school certificates, or farmer certificates or
driving licences and so on. For G2P mapper, this would mean choosing which social
benefit program do you want to pilot with - pensions or gas subsidies or
scholarships? For an AI assistant this could mean choosing which sector you would
want to simplify first - is it access to justice, or agricultural extension services for
farmers, or health scheme and insurance information? 
And in case you are wondering if the first use case really matters - the answer is a
resounding yes! Through the first case, you will be able to establish proof of
concept and proof of success of the DPI approach in your country for that block as
a whole. It is a critical move that will align different stakeholders as well as
individuals of the country at large with the new DPI method of doing things. Uber
launched in most emerging economies with Mercedes cars; the first impression
matters and should build immediate traction to solve a pain point.. 
Below are three simple questions that you can answer to lead you to choosing a
powerful first use case for your DPI block. 
Which use-case is...
1.Regularly used by individuals as a ‘toothbrushʼ use? Or addressing a big-
enough pain point?

37
For example, do people regularly need to show their income certificates to get
access to various programs and there is no way to verify them? Is the pension
scheme a large enough program through which money is transferred every month
but there is no way to map the accounts it is going to? If this is true, then it is a good
first use-case! On the other hand, converting school certificates into verifiable
credentials (that someone may hardly use in their lives) is not necessarily a
powerful first step. Try to select a use-case that addresses the daily needs of the
common man. This way there will be a big enough pain point that people are willing
to try something new in order to find an easier way to navigate that situation, and
the willingness to adopt the DPI will be higher. 
2.Covering large amounts of the population? 
It is ideal if the use-case has a large enough coverage in the country so that it can
create meaningful impact right from the start. For example, turning vaccine
certificates into a verifiable credential is something that affects everyone in the
country, as does receiving subsidies for food or gas. The larger the coverage of the
pain point, the faster will be the voluntary adoption of the DPI. If a very niche sector
is chosen as the first use-case it will be difficult to apply it cross-sectorally or use it
as proof of success for a larger population. 
3.Aligned with their line ministry on the DPI approach? 
The last important point to consider is whether the line ministry in charge of that
use case is also aligned to the DPI approach or can be efficiently brought on board.
For example, for verifying land records, is the home ministry alright with sharing the
land record database? For routing G2P for educational scholarships, is the
education ministry alright with sharing student records? Knowing you have the
agency over or approval of the line ministry required to execute the DPI block for
this use-case means that you now have a winning formula in your hand! 
Note: The first use case is different from first adopter! 
For example, the first DPI block can be data sharing, the first use case for data
sharing may be bank certificates, and the first adopter of the DPI use case may be a
digital lender who uses it to approve a small ticket loan! 

38
Similarly, the DPI block can be Open Discovery, the first use case for open
discovery can be mobility, and the first adopter can be a ride sharing startup who
wants to integrate it into his platform. 
A powerful combination of these three factors (first DPI block, use-case and
adopter) is the winning formula to help ensure your DPI is successful. 
While implementing the first DPI block it's always advised to pick three potential
use cases and three first adopters to pursue in parallel for a higher chance of
successful implementation 
Happy building!

Countries all around the world understand the need to digitise their economies. The
arguments for speed, efficiency, access to remote areas, and enhanced
transparency are well-documented. As the penetration of data, mobile devices and

As a result, many governments are drafting digital economy or digital
transformation strategies to keep pace with this evolution. However, concerns
around privacy, security and inclusive access still remain, with many countries in
the global south facing a higher risk of systemic exclusion of their last mile
populations in case a whole-of-government digital transformation effort is
undertaken. Fears of loss of privacy and security through misuse, mismanagement
or leakages of data are being voiced by countries across the globe, placing
governments at the centre of a precarious situation. Should they digitise (investing
heavily in the process) and risk the aforementioned outcomes, or should they
continue to operate as per current norms and risk the opportunity cost of non-
digitisation? 
Thankfully, as many countries such as India, Singapore, Brazil and others have
shown, the balance between an individualʼs privacy and institutional digitisation can
be achieved through well-designed Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)  approaches
that also guarantee access and inclusion for last mile populations. The principles of
DPI include 
1.Interoperability - ensuring the same rails can be accessed in a variety of ways
and are not built in silos, such as by setting out a QR code specification that can
allow for seamless digital payments from any store of value to any store of value
2.Minimalism - focusing on light touch interventions with high impact, such as by
designing an ID project that contains only 4 basic data fields similar to Aadhaar
in India, and doesnʼt try to capture ‘as much data as possibleʼ which would make
the infrastructure bulky and unsustainable 
3.Inclusive innovation - allowing for private market players to build on top of the
DPI in a regulated ecosystem. This will allow for diversity and quality in user
experience such as accessing the same payment rails through a smartphone,
feature phone, assisted modes etc. 
4.Federation - the key to secure systems is through federation and not
centralisation of data, such as by introducing an Open API policy that can allow
for async and synchronous data sharing without needing to store it in one place 
5.Security and Privacy - keeping individuals at the centre of systems and
ensuring that systems can proceed only upon receiving explicit revocable
granular consent by the individuals. 

43
The expansion from a digitisation strategy to a DPI strategy consists of light-touch
+1 steps that can be in-built into any pre-existing or newly built digital
transformation blueprint. The main purpose of DPI is to ensure that: 
1.The government can work towards asynchronous quick wins leveraging
existing infrastructure with minimal cost / time / effort investments that unlock
rapid benefits for individuals 
2.All individuals (irrespective of diversity in financial, social, educational or
accessibility backgrounds) can equitably access the digital rails built through
their existing capabilities 
3.Private market participation is incentivised to allow innovation over the
government sanctioned DPI rails to simultaneously support overall economic
growth and prosperity
These outcomes can be easily achieved through any well-designed DPI. Three tips
to help convert a digitisation strategy into a DPI strategy are: 
1.Focus on quick-wins alongside the larger digital transformation strategy:
Often, the digital transformation strategy is a robust document requiring
institutional establishment, policy changes, procurements, mandates, teams and
more. This is a necessary though time consuming process. In parallel to this, the
government could focus on executing smaller DPI pilots (such as verifiable
credentials) that do not require new policy mandates, multi-department
alignment or large procurement cycles. This will help demonstrate proof of
success of the digital transformation mission by delivering benefits to
individuals in the country and receive institutional support for the larger mission
as well, once everyone has had a chance to see results on the ground. 

44
2.Asynchronous adoption, instead of multi-department coordination, through
proof of value: Sometimes a significant blocker faced by countries during
executing a digital transformation strategy is resistance from various
government departments to align and coordinate on a single approach. This can
usually be difficult to resolve. It can be powerful to start rolling out DPI with the
first-mover departments who have forward-looking individuals that are aligned
with the approach and larger mission. Focusing on the DPI blocks that align with
the mandates and budgets of those departments can help speed up the process
of approvals and execution. Once a pilot or building block is live, other
departments and institutions should be free to asynchronously join the rails as
and when they see the proof of value it is offering the first-mover and its
beneficiaries. One example would be to roll-out a government to person
payment rails (through a G2P mapper) for the social benefit delivery that is
aligned with the DPI approach as perhaps the agricultural ministry for subsidies
to farmers for fertilisers. When the G2P rails are able to bring significant
reduction in the amount of leakages, thus saving the overall department budget,
other ministries or programs such as perhaps the food-subsidy program would
also want to join the rails and so forth. Asynchronous adoption may seem more
time consuming at the start, but it actually helps speed up the process of
execution, and results in more sustainable and scalable infrastructure models. 
3.Build on existing infrastructure as far as possible and not from scratch: It may
seem that to build something in line with DPI principles of privacy and security,
federation, inclusion or innovation, one has to build the infrastructure from
scratch since current systems may not cater to some or all of the
aforementioned principles. However, this is usually not the case. DPI by nature
consists of minimalist, light-touch interventions that can rapidly increase
inclusion and innovation at scale. It typically never advocates for long-
procurement cycles or uphauling whole-of-government systems. It is more
economical or effective to simply add a feature to existing systems to trigger
inclusive scale. For example, if there is a physical ID card with 30% coverage of
population, simply adding a digitally signed QR code to it would make it possible
to include features like e-authentication, e-kyc, or single-sign as well. These
three value-added features would immediately deliver value to individuals and
institutions and increase the voluntary adoption of the national ID card. 

45
Countries should avoid blind duplication of another countryʼs efforts. While it is
always useful and important to understand the best principles other countries have
adopted while designing their own infrastructure, and even having conversations
with them to learn from their mistakes, all this knowledge must be adapted to each
countryʼs unique socio-economic-political context before deployment. Another
countryʼs hosting choices (both technical and institutional) might not show the same
results when deployed in another country without proper contextualisation. 
The balance between the elements which can be standardised (and must be, in
order to save time, cost, effort and adopt global practices) and the surrounding
program architecture that must be contextualised (to show success in the deploying
country) must be achieved. One method of achieving this balance is through the 
DaaS Program that productises and packages the standardised elements while
allowing for consultations with CDPI (and other advisory partners) to adapt those
elements to solve unique societal scale challenges. 
In fact, all these +1 steps can be live in as little as 90 days through the DaaS
Program though they can also be built independently. The Centre for DPI stands
ready to help advise on converting any digitisation blueprint into a sustainable,
scalable, inclusive DPI strategy. 

46
How much does it cost to build DPI?
DPI does not have to be expensive to build!
It is famously said,
"Building DPI requires deep conviction and not deep pockets."
Some DPI cost the taxpayer almost nothing!
When people talk about 'Digital Public Infrastructure', they typically imagine large-
scale national ID projects, or digital payment networks. While these both are critical
aspects of DPI, they are not the only options. Many of DPI blocks in fact are small
+1 components that can be added on to existing infrastructure in the country to
convert them into high-functioning population scale resources. DPI can also be
updated to existing standards and protocols that allow the market to function more
effectively and inclusively.
If a country adopts a standard and orchestrates its adoption by the ecosystem, it
can drive an interoperable open network for various capabilities such as - for data
sharing (for credential issuance schema, or for registry access APIs, or for
consented personal data sharing); or for discovery and fulfilment (publication of
open APIs for government services including filing taxes; open standards for
discovery of any good or service (such as BeckN); or payments (publishing
interoperable QR standard for market to follow; cash in cash out standard for
interoperable cash withdrawal). Once the new standard is agreed upon, then the
team in charge just has to review the existing standards and publish a paper
outlining the update.
This is a 3-4 week process with little additional technical implementation cost for
the government. 
Other digital public Infrastructure can be brought to life in a country in two ways:

47
1.Greenfield DPI implementations: when the entire infrastructure is built from
scratch through a fresh private procurement route
2.Rapid DPI upgrades: when existing infrastructure is enhanced with +1 blocks to
convert them into powerful DPI. For example, converting an existing physical or
digital ID or document into a digitally verifiable identity by including a digitally
signed QR code on it, or converting a large database into a registry by opening
up its APIs for others to use.
The costs associated with both these approaches can vary significantly
1.Greenfield systems from scratch
The cost of building a national ID enrolment/registration and database management
infrastructure, for example, under the first approach would be a multi-million dollar
investment plus some fixed costs of maintaining the system.
Similarly, the startup cost to build a P2P / P2M payment system from scratch would
typically be less than 7 million (plus maintenance costs annually), requiring
investments from a consortium of banks if a payment switch operator is driving it
(or by the central bank if they choose to operate it themselves). These costs
typically have an extremely high RoI as mature payments systems move billions of
dollars in commerce monthly/annually.
2.  Rapid Upgrades to existing Digital Assets
Yet most countries arenʼt starting from scratch. Improvements to existing fast
payments rails to support payments systems to operate as DPI (e.g. by inserting a
QR code specification to make existing wallets and payment providers
interoperable; upgrading the API specifications to allow third party app payment
initiation; introducing a standard mode of authentication for third party apps to
complete payments; creating multi-party dispute resolution via open APIs; etc.
could cost only a few hundred thousand dollars for the entire project (including
tech and program costs) depending on the design and other variables.
Countries often already have some type of physical or digital infrastructure in place
and hence fall under the second category for most DPI implementations.

48
Based on our costing model, “Conversion” DPI building blocks such as verifiable
credentials (data sharing), ID auth / eSign / eKYC (layers on top of ID), G2P mapper
(payments / social benefit delivery) would typically require around $750k +/- 15%
(depending on the country context) over six months to roll out a high value and
reusable DPI at scale when built on existing systems.
Extending or deepening the implementation to add additional use cases over a 12
month period (illustrating the multi-domain impact of DPI) could cost around $1.3
Million (+/- 15%) in total. The costs of augmenting national P2P/P2M payment
systems varies more based on the scope/capabilities of the existing system.
In case countries wish to build these blocks to demonstrate quick wins with
powerful last mile benefits, they could also consider the DaaS Program and
receive support from private philanthropic sources and open source DPI packages
necessary to roll-out these capabilities. 
To view an indicative costing model that reflects the typical price ranges of a
minimalist DPI execution by leveraging an open source product, irrespective of
geography, please visit the standardised artefacts page. The model also outlines
standard team structures based on the technology and program requirements that can
support DPI execution. The costs represent extensive consultations with multiple
international and local private vendors and open source products across the world, on
a range of DPI blocks, based on their prior experience executing similar infrastructures
in other countries.

Is my system a DPI?
There is a flurry of activity in the DPI ecosystem: governments are building DPI from
scratch, open-source projects and digital public goods (DPGs) are developing DPI
solutions, funders are supporting DPI implementations, and private vendors are
marketing their DPI projects.
However, not everything labeled as DPI truly functions as such. How can you
quickly identify whether a system or solution is a genuine DPI architecture? 
Before diving in, let's recap a few key points:
•
Open source does not automatically mean DPI, nor do DPI implementations
need to rely solely on open-source solutions.
•
DPI implementations must use open APIs, open standards, and open
specifications to achieve interoperability and reusability. 
•
All DPI implementations are designed to be reusable by third-party public and
private institutions, and not just beneficial to the implementing institution.
•
Every DPI implementation must adhere to and internalise five key technical
design principles

50
Note:  Whether or not something is a DPI should not be thought of as a yes/no
checklist criteria; rather, a digital asset can grow in its maturity as a DPI for the
ecosystem depending on the value addition and innovation potential it provides at
affordable costs for both public and private use cases. 
That said, below are some key technical features that can help move certain key
digital systems or assets further in maturity along the journey to becoming robust
digital public infrastructure for the ecosystem. 
1.Digital ID system:
•
For a digital ID system to function as a DPI, it should have anID authentication
layer. This means the system should be able to process requests and return
yes/no answers for verification requests. 
•
For inclusion,  implementation can also support multiple authentication modes
(known as multi-modal authentication) for further inclusivity. For example, 
online (auth API, email one time password), 2G connected (mobile one time
password) and offline (verifiable QR on paper) modes, multiple modes for 
biometric auth such fingerprint matching, face matching, iris matching,  etc. 
Additionally, more mature ID systems should enable the following capabilities:
•
eKYC (API-based profile data sharing based on a successful authentication
for ease of onto external public or private services) 
•
Single Sign-On(enabling login to other public or private goods and services
via the ID)
•
e-signing (replacing a wet signature with an ID-enabled electronic signature),
which all help trigger a high-trust digital economy)
2.Registries containing personal data:
Registries are one of the most common digitisation implementations, often
understood as simple databases.
A registry implementation can be considered a DPI if it stores data 

51
•
in a machine-readable,
•
digitally signed format 
•
that external parties - both public and private - can access 
a. The first and simplest way to enable data sharing using registries to generate 
verifiable credentials for the holder as a natural exhaust for the stored data. 
b. Registries operating as mature DPI can also enable access system to system
directly via open APIs. These open API standards can come from self-defined
national standards or derived from well-accepted open specifications like the G2P
Connect/ DCI APIs.
3.Digital Payments Infrastructure :
a. Peer-to-Peer/Person-to-Merchant (P2P/P2M) Payments
Often, instant bank-to-bank payment systems are packaged as DPI
implementations. However, for a P2P/P2M payments infrastructure to truly operate
as DPI, it should be
Inclusive: The infrastructure should have scaled to usage by the majority of the
population without significant cost or technology barriers 
Interoperable: To operate as a mature DPI, a payments rails should support the
movement of money across:
•
Any account used for payment (Bank, Wallet, Mobile Money, Credit Lines)
•
Any app used to pay (Bank, Wallet, Mobile Money, Fintech)
•
Any device or channel (Feature phones, PoS machines, Smartphones, QR
stickers; Online/Offline, Dynamic QR)
•
Any recipient of payment (P2P, P2M, P2G, G2P, etc.)
This represents the ideal (though evolving) state of nature payments DPI. Countries
do not need to build all of this on day one though - they can add capabilities as they
build, but the initial architecture should be future-proof, programmable, and easily
extensible allowing ease of addition of new features.

52
b. G2P Payments 
Government-to-Person (G2P) benefits is a complex ecosystem with many modules,
including scheme management, beneficiary management, disbursement systems,
settlement systems, and last-mile cash-in/cash-out systems, all spread across
various departments. 
The presence of a digitised G2P infrastructure does not automatically imply a DPI
implementation. Some modules, such as beneficiary scheme management, are simply
digital solutions.
G2P systems can operate as DPI by utilizing reusable infrastructure, such as 
registries, an ID-Account mapper, and cash in cash out standards.
•
Collected beneficiary data can be converted into a registry for reuse by other
departments (see #2 on registries).
•
An ID-Account mapper (a four-field registry mapping a verifiable ID or phone
number to an account number) can be used to route payments without
repetition.
4.Data sharing infrastructure - Personal :
a. User-centric Verifiable Credentials
Digitally issuing PDF certificates in a dedicated app or platform is not considered a
DPI approach on its own. Credentials operate as DPI when they are digitally signed,
machine-readable, and can be shared with and verified by anyone. Adding a
signed QR to a PDF certificate is a quick and simple way to convert a digital
certificate to a DPI. For more mature data-sharing DPI, the API standards for sharing
credentials and the schema for defining the content should be harmonised at a
national level.
b. System to system Real-time data sharing networks

53
A centralised data warehouse or repository of personal data is not typically
considered a DPI (unless crafted as a Registry above). The DPI approach involves
creating federated, open data-sharing networks where any data consumer or
provider can plug in to receive or share data as per the network's rules. It is highly
recommended to collect user consent as part of this flow. Open API standards (for
data sharing) and schema will need to be defined at a sector/ national level.
5.Data Sharing Infrastructure - Anonymised Data:
Uploading PDFs or Excel files in bulk for public consumption is not usually
considered DPI, because of its low reusability potential. Anonymised aggregated
data should be made available to third parties in a machine-consumable format
with APIs for access. Permissions and licensing terms can be set on these data
sets.
6.Unifying government Services :
Many governments use an Enterprise Services Bus (ESB) solution to unify the
various services provided by the government into a single-window application or
portal. While this architecture is useful, it is also very complex, difficult to maintain
and scale, and requires interdepartmental consensus.
The DPI approach would be if each department would open its APIs for a service
and publish them for third parties to consume and integrate into their workflows. 
The Department of ICT, for example, could compile all these open APIs and make
them easily accessible for integration.
Alternatively, existing government services buses could open up collectively the
APIs for all the services they have aggregated.
Note: This article only discusses technical metrics; Good, participatory governance
and inclusive market innovations are equally crucial for a DPI implementation

Mythbusters and FAQs

56
DPI and Mandating Adoption
Question: Is mandating adoption necessary to achieve scale for various Digital
Public Infrastructure building blocks? 
Short Answer: Typically not. While sometimes mandating adoption may help speed
up the process of achieving scale, in the long run, voluntary adoption based on a
strong value proposition to all market players and citizens is more sustainable at
driving impact. DPI-builders should prepare for asynchronous adoption over time
starting with smaller players, rather than wait for the largest incumbents to agree
before launching.
Long Answer: Countries are often faced with this dilemma: there is often hesitation
or reluctance on the part of market players or existing institutions of the country to
upgrade to a DPI approach, or apathy of individuals in accessing or using the DPI
(such as with digital identities). They may be sceptical of the value it would provide
them, or have vested interests in previous legacy systems.  
Mandating adoption may feel like a faster solution in some cases; and there is proof
that it can be effective in the short run - particularly in regulated sectors where a
regulator or government entity can enforce changes. However, a mandatory
implementation approach can also lead to increased resistance by institutions
towards infrastructure or approaches that are seemingly forced upon them by the
authorities, or create a ‘checkbox implementationʼ syndrome where the DPI is
adopted in name but is not done with high quality. For instance, regulators
sometimes mandate the use of open banking APIs - but banks could implement
them with low success rates, effectively meeting the compliance burden without
changing consumer experience. 
Moreover, mandating DPI adoption leaves the system vulnerable to policy changes.
If the policy leadership changes a few years down the line and they reverse the
mandate, all the momentum achieved may be lost. Finally, if it is mandated, market
players may view it as a compliance issue and not necessarily devote their best
talent into it. 

57
A more sustainable option would be to encourage voluntary adoption of the
infrastructure at scale. This can be done simply by making DPI building blocks
immediately useful for the individuals and institutions so that they can clearly see
benefits, reduced costs, improved efficiencies, or market value of adopting it. DPI
can be designed with strong incentives to adopt for all stakeholders. 
Some examples are:  
DPI Block How to expedite voluntary adoption 
Digital Identity enrollment
Create value to the citizen  of having/using
the Identity - This can be done by
encouraging other departments or market
players to use electronic ID authentication,
or providing a verifiable credential of the
identity or a profile data eKYC API so that
the individual can fast track their access to
key services (eg filing govʼt compliances,
access to benefits, opening bank accounts,
getting SIM cards, etc).  
Registry enrollment/update by institutions
Create value to the institution populating the
registry (e.g. a health facility registry or a
land registry) by encouraging other
departments or market players to use data
fields or authentication capabilities of the
registry, publishing open APIs for the
registry to enable discovery by external
market players, profile data eKYC to fast
track onboarding in key services, etc. 
Data Sharing (e.g. Open Banking/Open
Finance; G2G data exchanges, etc) 
1.
Craft a reciprocity policy that ensures
that in order to access data from any
other actor in the data sharing
ecosystem, you must also provide data
to the ecosystem.
2.
Craft a clear use case for a high value
service that is improved based on
access to data. For instance, for open
banking, the use case is often improved
lending portfolios, which can scale up
based on access to data. 

58
These features reinforce the spirit of the DPI approach to keep the individual at the
centre of all systems and to only move with an individual's consent and interests at
heart. When the incumbents realise that the DPI is not eating into their market
share, but rather offering them more opportunities for growth and success, they will
automatically want to join in. DPI does not just allow more people to have a share of
the pie, but it also increases the pie so that everyone may have a larger share. This
may not happen at first, and ecosystem facilitation adoptions should be
comfortable with an async adoption pace with small challenger organisations going
first and larger ones joining in later. 
This gesture of allowing voluntary adoption also builds a layer of trust between
governments, institutions, and people. It carries an intrinsic layer of faith that the
DPI solution is secure, futuristic, creates value, and therefore will scale on its own
merit. This silent surety on the part of governments as well as the clearly defined,
immediately available benefits will give individualʼs the boost they need to rise to
the occasion - and raise their country with them. 
The best part? People-driven transformation is lasting - across the changing tides
of policy and procurements.

59
DPI and Private Competition
Question: Does building Digital Public Infrastructure hamper the growth of a
competitive economy? 
Short Answer: Not if it is built in accordance with best practice design principles.
DPI increases healthy, fair competition in an economy amongst players and triggers
tremendous market value. DPI means public interest, not necessarily public
ownership or execution. 
Long Answer: The word ‘publicʼ of Digital Public Infrastructure is often
misconstrued to mean that all components of the infrastructure will be owned and
operated by the government, leaving little room for private sector players to build
solutions and derive value. One hesitation in adopting DPI lies in the
misunderstanding that it will obstruct the free flow of competition in a laissez faire
economy, or crowd out the private sector from providing services. 
However, there is much more nuance here. The word ‘publicʼ in DPI denotes that all
solutions built, whether private or by the government, are in the best interests of the
public. It signals that the individual should be at the centre of the economy and at
the heart of all endeavours. The role of the government in DPI may simply be to lay
out the rules which enforce this idea of ‘people before profitsʼ to nurture free and
fair competition that is the backbone of any healthy society. 
Every sport is played according to certain rules, and there are penalties for violating
them - yet, we donʼt look at these rules as obstructions to the game but rather as
necessary guardrails which keep players safe and the game interesting. Similarly,
the DPI game is about laying down certain rules - such as Interoperability, Privacy
and Security, Federation, Inclusion and Minimalism - which act as guardrails to
prevent monopolies, unfair practices, and dictatorial tendencies. 
Not only does DPI allow for competition in the existing economy, it also creates new
avenues for private sector growth and innovation. The analogy commonly used is
that DPI doesnʼt just allow more people to eat from the pie but it also increases the
size of the pie so that everyone, including incumbents, get a larger market share in
ways they could not have previously imagined. 

60
DPI creates potential for competition at every level of its execution, adoption, and
growth. For example, in Payments, the government attempts to build only when
decades of market players trying to solve this problem have resulted in silos,
exclusions and market failures. The government builds only the minimalistic rails
and not necessarily the applications (innovation layer). The market players can
build their own apps on top of the rails (adoption layer). Once you build DPI in
payments, it also unlocks other layers such as lending where a new playing field for
market players (execution layer). 
The layers of private participation (in more detail) are: 
1.Innovation Layer: 
Once DPI has scaled, there are various ancillary services that can be built on top of
it that leverage its benefits. For example, the interoperability and verified credentials
gained through Open Banking (data-sharing as well as payments) create the
foundation for Insurance, Lending, and eCommerce use cases to be built on top of
it. DPI attempts to solve only the minimum bottleneck - e.g. verifying a few profile
data fields - without entering the realm of final solutions or service delivery. 
2.Adoption Layer: 
Once the DPI has been built, it is only successful if it adopted by the market players
to offer improved services to people of the country to truly scale. Every country has
its share of diversity in the form of demographics, abilities, income levels etc., and
no single platform can adequately cater to all of them. The second layer of the DPI
approach - market innovation layer - pushes for private sector innovation and
competition to cater to these different segments of society using User Experience
as the key differentiator. By creating a level playing field, the DPI approach ensures
that the best player wins on the basis of the value provided to the end user. 
3.Execution Layer:

61
While the DPI approach can be triggered by the government, it actually requires
significant private sector participation - typically via Technology Service Providers
(TSPs) and System Integrators (SIs) to roll out the DPI on a nation-wide scale. This
allows for innovation from and competition between various market players to offer
the best contract and build at a country level using best practices for design and
governance.
There is a widely popular anecdote from the Indian sphere in this regard. It is said
that after Indiaʼs foundational identity ‘Aadhaarʼ had scaled, and offered eKYC
services on top of it, Amazon went to the Indian Government and requested for an
Aadhaar for businesses! 
Amazon said that the only way for them to accurately verify businesses that wanted
to be listed on its e-commerce platform was through national, digitally signed
documents for a business including the eKYC ability. 
This is the perfect example to display that even the largest private sector players
benefit from the DPI approach because it allows them capabilities and
functionalities it could not have previously solved. 
DPI solves for every last individual in the country - and this includes the individuals
running private sector businesses!  

62
DPI and Privacy / Security
Question: Does DPI reduce personal privacy, increase security risks, or hurt public
safety by increasing capacity for surveillance?
Short Answer: Well designed DPI actually improves your control over your own
data, is minimalist in data collection (sufficient for access to services and nothing
more!), opts for federation rather than centralisation of data, and builds security and
privacy preserving features (such as tokenisation, auto data deletion, auditable and
tamper proof logs of data access and use, etc.) by design. Successful national ID
systems that scale for example, have a minimalist set of data fields so the chances
of loss of privacy even in case of a data-breach is low - contrarily, the internet has
millions of data points of any individual and much less safeguards (both technical
and moral) to protect it.
Long Answer: Digital Public Infrastructure enables solutions to be built at scale -
catering to diverse populations with varying levels of ability and resources, in an
equitable manner. This scale and impact can ONLY be achieved by institutionalising
data minimalism, privacy and security, and public trust into the systems (as DPI only
scales with public and private adoption, which requires trust).
For example, design features of a countryʼsnational (digital) ID system that
preserve privacy and trust should include:

63
Minimalism in data capture - The less data is captured, the less of a honeypot
is created.
Avoiding tracking - no collection of location/purpose in ID auth/eKYC
Creating a Virtual ID or a token as a fungible alias for the permanent ID to avoid
providing the actual ID number for services
Authentication done with consent of the user (via one time password or
biometrics)
Usage audits which are permanently auto-deleted every n months
End-to-end encryption for data at rest and data transport layers
Allowing residents to lock their ID and/or biometrics, disabling authentication
Unique tokens that are different for every system, eliminating the ability to
merge databases
Multi-factor authentication for high value transactions
Advanced cybersecurity measures for database security, including periodic
ethical hacker tests
Features of an interoperable data sharing systemto drive enhanced privacy and
security could include:
Avoiding centralisation of data to prevent honeypots - letting data remain
where it has been collected, and crafting protocols for real time sharing in a
federated manner.
Introducing the ability to query databases for a yes or no response as per a
criteria or question, without always requesting the raw data for analysis
Introducing a detailed, granular consent (purpose specific and data specific)
artefact (digitally signed for added security) required from the individual to
share data
Allowing consent to be managed by a data-blind third-party who acts on
behalf of individuals (not the information providers or information users) to
ensure an actor with incentives aligned with the individual is showing them a
consent request (rather than a data user or provider)
A pre-specified time period for access to data - with consent revocable at any
time by the individual
Multi-factor, multi-modal authentication capabilities for signing in to the
system

64
For instance, Brazilʼs PIX has prioritized security in its payment system through a
combination of technologies and regulatory measures: It uses encryption
protocols, two-factor authentication to verify user identities and digitally signed
transactions, with possibility to reverse payment within a certain time window. 
The financial network itself is not connected to the internet, and only restricted
participants can actually access the database directly, in addition to regulatory
oversight by the Central Bank of Brazil which ensures compliance with financial
security standards and promotes user trust in the system. 
Another example is Aadhaar - Indiaʼs ID system which collects only 4 minimal,
constant fields of an individual - name, date of birth, address, gender. This means
that the data is always accurate. Now what if they had collected 10 fields including
profession, income, family members, etc? This could change year on year, making
the data redundant. Collecting and storing that information would also make
systems bulky and inefficient - affecting the speed and accuracy of all systems that
use it (such as banks using ID data for eKYC). 
If data privacy wasnʼt guaranteed, and personal information could be shared freely
across departments - for example, if the payments system could send information
about your transactions to the tax authorities who subsequently showed up at
your doorstep - would anyone sign up for those solutions? Likely not! And DPI
would never be able to scale or sustain.
Evidence of its robust minimalism, privacy, and security is evident in the
widespread adoption and long-term sustainability of critical systems like verifiable
identities, interoperable payments, healthcare claims settlement networks,
education credentials, mobility, and commerce networks globally.

65
While all technical systems face vulnerabilities, well-designed DPI anticipates and
prepares for potential attacks. . If information from a minimalist system is leaked -
information that is already more or less public such as your name, date of birth,
gender, etc. - you stand to lose much less than when large systems are breached
such as your internet history, social media footprints, email accounts etc. which
have more damning repercussions. The fear of our internet accounts being
breached doesn't stop us from using the internet, similarly, the remote fear of DPI
systems being breached should never be a barrier to implementing beneficial
measures at scale. We must simply build resilient, secure systems that can stand
the test of time.
There are multiple ways to ensure data minimalism, security and privacy such as
those outlined above. Similar safeguards can be put in place using a techno-legal
approach for all solutions built through the DPI approach. These measures can
solidify systems to reduce the probability that a malicious actor can use the
systems to increase surveillance, or cause intentional harm.

66
DPI and the Digital Divide
Question: Will DPI deepen the digital divide?
Short Answer: Nope. DPI is not the same as digitisation. Well designed DPI caters
equally to people with and without connectivity, and with and without smartphones.
Long Answer: Often the word ‘digitalʼ of the term ‘digital public infrastructureʼ is
misconstrued to mean that it always requires internet connectivity and access to
smartphones and thus, leaves behind the people who donʼt have access to such
technology, connectivity, or devices. 
DPI is often, mistakenly, used interchangeably with digitisation (the process of
taking paper-based processes online). The DPI approach is sometimes met with
scepticism from countries who may have many barriers to cross before a fully-
online world becomes a reality for them. This fear - that DPI will not be able to
bridge the digital divide - remains one of the most unfortunate misunderstandings
of our time!
The core mission of solutions built through the DPI approach is to reach the last
mile population where they are and integrate them into the formal society in a
variety of ways. It is fully cognisant of the fact that countries are inherently diverse
- there will be people who are fully privileged, and those who lack access to basic
resources, education and abilities in every society. For services to truly scale
inclusively, one has to reach people on both ends of the spectrum and cater to a
diverse population via multi-modal access points and solution-agnostic protocols
that are not hardwired to any specific format in which to access services..The
availability of multiple options is what ultimately drives inclusion across diverse
populations, and ultimately, DPI aims to elevate underserved communities to a level
economic playing field through equal access, despite their current resources. 
For example, when we speak about a Digital ID, they are not necessarily dependent
on smart cards, or online authentication modes only. 

67
Similarly, when we speak about interoperable digital payments as DPI, they are not
limited to those with access to digital devices: 
Has an email account and connectivity 
Can generate email-based one-time
password (OTP) 
Mobile Device (Feature phone or
smartphone) with connectivity 
Mobile-based OTP 
Mobile Device without connectivity Offline XML authentication
No mobile devices or connectivity
If verifier has a card reader: Smart Card
authentication of a fingerprint stored on a
chip (requires verifier to have a card reader)
No mobile devices or connectivity 
If verifier has a biometric reader: Fingerprint
authentication with fingerprint reader 
A mobile device, but no connectivity and
challenge with fingers/fingerprints 
If verifier has phone: Face authentication
If verifier has biometric reader: Iris
authentication with iris scanner 
No devices, no connectivity, challenge with
fingerprints/iris
Demographic field authentication via a
digitally signed QR code on a paper or
plastic-based ID card

68
Well designed DPI are suit diverse audiences with unique needs. It is important to
note that the same DPI rails - using standard protocols - can cater to all sets of
people and newer innovations can simply be added on top without needing to
extensively change the underlying codes or protocols or building separate solutions
for rural contexts or vulnerable populations (which tend to be under-maintained). 
Solutions built through the DPI approach are required to be: 
Payers in urban areas with access to
smartphones and connectivity
Make payments (P2P, P2M) by scanning a
QR code via their smartphone or entering a
financial address through any mobile
application 
Street vendors in urban areas without
smartphones
Instead of purchasing an expensive credit
or debit card reader to accept payments,
they can simply print a QR code on a piece
of paper to accept digital payments
Payers in rural or Semi-urban areas with
feature phones but no internet connectivity 
They can use USSD to send an SMS text
message (e.g. using a specific number like
*99#) as a payment instruction to transfer
funds to anyone using mobile networks
They can also initiate payments as above to
interoperable offline wallets or mobile
money accounts to transact without
messaging core banking systems
Rural areas with no phones or connectivity
They can use their biometrics (such as a
fingerprint) to authorise payment
transactions through any local vendor
Local languages / illiterate / cannot see
clearly
They can call a number and speak in their
local language. An AI-enabled service can
translate their instructions into a payment
instruction and carry out the transaction
using the standard DPI rails on their behalf
after receiving authorisation. 

69
1.Minimalist 
2.Modular
3.Reusable 
4.Federated 
5.Secure
This allows for inclusive innovation with diverse access methods to be easily built
on top of the foundational rails.

Technical Notes

71
Identifiers & Registries
Who is the counterparty? Can I trust them?
Verifying ID & accessing profile data of people, entities, & objects is a crucial
foundational function of digital economies. When moving from physical to digital
interactions, the first complication is establishing trust as to the identity of the
counterparty. It is crucial that this identity is verifiable: i.e. can be authenticated in
some means (a mobile one time password, a digitally signed QR code, a biometric
fingerprint scan, or even a face ID authentication). 
A country should have multiple identities to fulfill multiple purposes and functions
across sectors - but one or more of them should provide a foundational capability
of authenticating that the individual is who they say they are, and returning a few
commonly required data fields (such as name, gender, date of birth, and address)
via an open API. Functional identities (such as voter IDs, social protection IDs, or
drivers licenses) should also strive to make their profile data accessible via APIs or
through other digitally native means. 
An identity system is a registry of persons. Countries also need foundational
registries of entities (such as businesses, hospitals, schools, etc.) to allow sector-
specific digital service providers to innovate based on shared datasets. These
registries should provide digitally signed data - to ensure it is tamper proof - and
preferably via open APIs (and prevent clunky PDF or excel downloads) to ensure
software can directly consume the information. This greatly enhances the speed of
service delivery and the competition across sector specific market players.   
Key examples of building blocks in this category of DPIs include: 
•
Authentication (Mobile, Offline QR Code based, Biometric, Face, etc)
•
eKYC
•
Single Sign On 
•
Civil/Functional Registries
•
Entity Registries
•
Object Registries (land,etc.)

72

73
Digital ID
Government's primary aim is to reach out to specific target user base to easily 
identify a user and deliver govt services - e.g. medical care, pensions, collect
taxes, etc., Every country can relate to existence of at-least one of the below
identity systems:
1.National Registration Cards (NRC)
2.Regional Govts Identity Cards
3.Registrations done with one or more biometric modalities (finger, iris, face,
voice, etc.,) but may or may not have used for deduplication / uniqueness
checks
4.Foundational identities - Civil Birth/Death, National Id, etc.,
5.Purpose driven functional identities - Voting, Driving, Farming, Taxation,
Professional Practice (Doctor, Lawyer, Teacher, etc.,)
6.Foundational/Functional IDs restricted to certain category of users - e.g., All
Citizens, Citizens above x years, Residents, Refugees, etc.,
In most of the countries foundational or functional IDs are issued as:
Context

74
1.Simple paper optionally with a photo and/or hologram sticker 
2.Laminate the paper based ID
3.PVC card with one more security features like:
a.Photo
b.Hologram sticker
c.Micro text
d.Ghost image
e.ID authority logo
f.Guilloche patterns
g.Issue/expiry dates printed
h.Barcode / QR Code / Magnetic Strip / RFID / Smart Chip
i.etc.,
While the above IDs are enrolled and issued with multiple levels of physical
verification, the IDs issued within a jurisdiction do have a good level of trust and
acceptance within the country to deliver govt services. However, governments are 
challenged to accept foundational or functional IDs for various reasons:
1.Detecting genuine vs fraudulent ID cards;
2.Trusting scanned QR code content;
3.Procuring large number of  vendor specific card readers (ID cards with RFID,
smart chip);
4.Reissuing expired ID cards;
5.Trusting IDs outside of the issuing authority jurisdiction / network (service
points, systems);
In these challenging scenarios governments are trying to address globally accepted
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by adopting digital transformation
programs. Governments and Development Agencies are investing large sums of
money to digitise business processes by building portals, mobile apps, and
platforms to reach the target user base while NOT able to IDENTIFY &
AUTHENTICATE the user with 100% TRUST.

75
DIGITISING AN EXISTING ID INTO A DIGITAL ID CAN OPEN UP NON LINEAR
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOVTS TO DRIVE DIGITAL INCLUSION VIA UNIVERSALLY
ACCEPTED, TRUSTED DIGITAL IDs.
Any foundational or functional ID that supports below properties is considered a
Digital ID:
What is a Digital ID?

76
1.Human/System Readable - Digital ID MUST be presented in a format that can
be read by a human and systems. Key user identity attributes MUST be made
available in QR Code format for systems to easily scan and read.
2.Verifiable - QR Code component of ID MUST be digitally signed by the issuing
authority and verification of digital signature to prove non-repudiability be made
possible. Human verifying a QR code can be made possible using QR Code
reader apps/sdk's.
3.Online/Offline Accessible - Digital ID MUST be accessible through Online APIs.
Digital ID MUST also be made available for offline use through digital wallets or
by digitally signed QR codes.
4.Online/Offline Authentication - Digital ID MUST be able to authenticate the
user both in online and offline modes. In Offline mode authentication service
points are able to verify users in low or no network coverage regions with trust.
5.Consented Use - Use of Digital ID SHALL enable mechanisms to implement
consents from the ID holder during authentication or data access or while other
uses of ID.
6.Privacy Protecting - Digital ID SHALL enable option to mask ID for usage
scenarios where full ID is not required and ensure necessary consented
authorisation for data access.
7.Self / Assisted Use Cases - Digital ID SHALL enable self & assisted use cases
to access, verify and authenticate the user with consents. Use of authorised
operators helps to reach digitally illiterate users and helps in inclusion via open
APIs with necessary authorisation by the ID holder. 
8.Enable Full/Selective KYC Disclosure - Digital ID SHALL enable option to
release full or selective Know Your Customer (KYC) attributes for downstream
use of ID.
9.Unique ID - Digital ID MAY be deduplicated against biometric or demographic
data to ensure ONLY unique IDs are issued. Uniqueness of an ID is NOT a
necessary requirement. Many use cases do not require to identify and
authenticate an unique user. Identifying and easily/securely authenticating a
user is sufficient. 
10.Laws/Regulations - Digital ID MAY be governed by local laws/regulations to
ensure equitable access to ecosystem participants across sectors to reduce
friction and costs. Laws/regulations ensures acceptance of DIGITAL ID called
out though above properties to create a multiplier effect as a foundational
Digital Public Infrastructure.

77
Many govt programs do not require a unique ID to deliver services. Very few
services may actually require a unique id. Use of Digital IDs shall allow policy
makers to reduce friction/cost and to allow integration between systems.
Digital ID use shall enable policy makers to integrate with other jurisdiction
functional idʼs while finding duplicates through trusted demographic data
techniques is a continuous improvement process to remove ghost beneficiaries.
Digital IDs made available from existing functional ID systems can eventually link to
deduplicated foundational IDs i.e when a country adopts such a deduplicated
issuance platform.
While a biometric deduplicated ID system is considered a fool proof ID issuance
platform, Governments need not wait for such an ideal scenario to identify a user
with TRUST both in physical and digital worlds. 
Governments can consider below indicative suggestions as an inspiration to to
convert physical IDs to Digital IDs:
Why is Digital ID important?
How to convert an existing ID to a Digital ID

78
1.Govt should enable issuance and use of PKI certificates as per globally
accepted practices within the country.
2.ID authority that owns and maintains a physical registry can consider digitising
the data as is into a database.
3.Any additional clean up to improve the quality of the data formats should be
taken up during this phase.
a.Latest good quality photo and/or verified mobile number should be part of
the ID database/registry
b.These two key ID attributes shall open up verification and authentication
capabilities.
4.ID authority should procure PKI certificates to issue Online Digital IDs through
Auth/eKYC APIs and Offline Digital IDs through mobile wallet / eLocker apps.
5.ID authority should enable govt and private ecosystem players to access Digital
ID through apiʼs, self/assisted use, acceptance of digitally signed docs, cyber &
information security laws, user privacy laws and related policies.
Merging many different identity cards is not necessary, and in fact, various
countries retain a combination of functional IDs (such as a driver's license, farmers
certificate etc.) and foundational IDs. 
A foundational ID is able to scale to become a national ID only when it is minimalist
(captures the very basic 5-7 data points on an individual such as name, gender,
date of birth, address, and some authentication capabilities) and delivers value
through reusability (by e-auth and e-kyc). 
e-Authentication is a feature that can submit a yes/no response when asked, and e-
KYC is a feature that can submit foundational profile fields in addition to
authentication. The single-sign-on capability allows an individual to log-on to any
government or private portal on the basis of their government issued iD (similar to
using a Google account to log on to a website). 
Merging multiple different ID cards into one card is not
necessary

79
For functional IDs, building an auth feature would be most useful since other
departments can verify the identity of the concerned individual before issuing a
service to them (such as a social benefits department authenticates if a person is a
farmer before transferring money to them). 
For national IDs(such as minor ID, passport, Non-resident ID), e-auth or SSO may
be built. 
And for the national foundational ID, either of the three features may be built for
individuals to utilise. 
These capabilities can be built on any current identity in the country (depending on
the nature of the ID) within a matter of weeks and leveraged by individuals and
institutions to access trusted information based on the individual's consent to
provide more efficient access to services such as opening a bank account or
availing benefits through a government portal.  
IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1.EACH COUNTRY MUST HAVE THEIR OWN STRATEGY TO MAKE
FOUNDATIONAL & FUNCTIONAL IDS AVAILABLE AS DIGITAL IDs. 
2.THIS DIGITAL ID CONCEPT FOR A PERSON CAN BE EXTENDED TO
ORGANISATIONS, ENTITIES AND THINGS.
3.HAVING A DIGITAL ID IS MUST HAVE DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE (DPI)
FOR ANY DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY!

Capabilities on ID system
How to convert any ID system into a DPI
Building a use cases layer on top of any foundational/ functional ID system is crucial
in unlocking service delivery.  ID should be considered an infrastructure to provide
citizens seamless access to services. An ID system is only as powerful as the use
cases it can unlock. This is also how countries can encourage enrollment and
ensure that their ID system is “sticky”. The layers built on an identity system
outlined below can make an existing ID system operate as digital public
infrastructure in an economy, and can all help increase the enrollment/adoption and
usage of an identity.

81
ID-Auth
In the previous section, we discussed the concept of a digital ID. Itʼs imperative to
reiterate that thecore attributesof a digital ID are that it is both machine and
human-readable, verifiable, and digitally signed to ensure it is tamper-proof.
Verifying the identity of a user (also called authentication) before any transaction is
a fundamental function in any economy, and is the key feature that can upgrade any
existing ID system to help it operate as digital public infrastructure. Everyday
activities like opening a bank account, availing a government service, purchasing a
new mobile sim card, etc. necessitate a layer of trust and traceability. Traditionally,
verification has been done by producing physical copies of any issued govt.
document and acceptance of the document was left to the individual/ entity
providing service. This is a low-trust, time-consuming, and expensive process.
The most powerful application/ addition of any identifier is to use it for electronic
authentication across a digital economy by any public or private player. This can be
done by building a digital auth layer on top of the ID system, enabling people to
prove their identities online or offline. 
ID authentication is the process by which an ID number or a tokenized version of
the ID along with one type of authentication factor is used to verify a citizen's
identity.  The ID system can be queried and it will provide a Yes/ No response to
the question - “Are you who you claim to be?”
There are a few key modes of authentication:
1.Demographic; which verifies a personʼs name, address, date of birth, or other
information fields
2.Biometric; which verifies a personʼs fingerprints or iris 
3.Face auth; which verifies a personʼs face picture
4.One-time password; where a single-use password is sent to a registered mobile
number or email address

82
ID Authentication provides an API-based authentication mechanism for entities to
validate individuals. In each of the above cases, the ID number and one piece of
information are submitted to the ID authorityʼs database for its verification and the
ID authority verifies the correctness of the details submitted, or the lack thereof. 
Additionally, offline local ID authentication can happen if the ID authority offers a
digitally signed artefact i.e. JSON/XML document (as a file or in QR code format)
with foundational/functional ID or ID alias, photo, and any other minimal information
required for validation to deliver a service.
Depending on the strength of verification required, two-factor authentication can
also be considered. In all these cases, the citizen is assumed to have consented to
the verification process.
Authentication should be thought through three key dimensions :
•
Proof: What's the authentication intended to prove? Is it proof of document,
proof of identity, proof of presence or proof of existence.
•
Self and assisted channels
•
Offline and onlinemodes

83
Building this authentication layer on ID and opening it to licensed private/ public
service providers is a huge step towards innovation as well as inclusion. Online,
low-cost, and almost instant authentication will power the rise of an entirely new
class of applications and increase trust in the digital economy. 
1.Hard Infrastructure, connectivity & coverage: Procurement of any specialized
hardware for authentication can become prohibitively expensive at a national
scale. This and accessibility constraints can impede the delivery of services in
rural, remote areas. 
Probable challenges & workarounds:

84
•
A choice that any government can make in this regard is to allow private players
to become e-auth service providers after adequate training & certification.
Opting to publish all the hardware standards brings market forces into play,
resulting in competitive prices for everyone.
•
Offering offline mobile-first authentication can eliminate the need for smaller
scale verifiers to procure expensive hardware such as smartcard readers or
biometric scanners. 
2.Inclusion & scale: Not all segments of the population can utilise biometrics due
to factors such as age or disability. Additionally, not everyone possesses the
digital proficiency to own or use a mobile phone. Overlooking these realities
risks excluding these vulnerable groups from accessing vital services.
•
Enabling multimodal (via OTP, QR codes, biometrics and face) & offline
authentication will solve for inclusion at scale - increasing the coverage of
services.
3.Data security & privacy: Concerns about the security of data and possible
misuse of the shared information.
•
Itʼs on the government to balance innovation while ensuring that no one has
uncontrolled access to private data.  The concerned government departments
can choose to identify authorised service providers after licensing and testing.
These should be mandated to maintain logs of data accessed, which can then
be scrutinised by the regulators.
The digital ID serves as a key to a broad spectrum of services, encompassing
financial inclusion, social protection, and efficient benefits delivery. Seamless,
inexpensive user verification can power multiple use cases within the govt. and
beyond. For example, 
•
Authentication for benefits delivery like - 
- G2P payments
-   Health insurance coverage 
- Enrollment in scholarship programs 

85
- Subsidies distribution
•
Voter registration
•
Biometric attendance for govt. Officials or schemes
•
Authentication for data fetches (such as credentials)
•
Face authentication for liveness

Face Authentication
Approach to enabling inclusion in onboarding individuals for use cases such as
social protection
Authenticating a user is most primitive action in any service delivery. Assuming
user's registered photo is available in digital form and is easily verifiable, opening
up face authentication on mobile phone app(s) creates non linear scale in providing
services in an inclusive way.
1.Country or any department offers a digitally signed artefact i.e JSON/XML
document as file or in QR code format with foundational/functional ID or ID alias,
Photo and any other minimal information requried for validation to deliver a
service.
2.Access to this digitally signed artefact can be through a digitial copy shared or
securely cached on a mobile device, scanned through QR code using a printed
or physically issued card.
Following are few common challenges in any given country / context that is the
primary cause for user exclusion who may other wise can be easily reached to
deliver services:
Overview
Assumptions
Challenges

87
1.Access : Not all users are digitally savy to own and/or operate a mobile phone.
2.Reach : Network connectivity or coverage is a universal challenge to avial
online services.
3.Digital Literacy : Many users lack digital financial literacy e.g., handling of
PIN/OTPs.
4.Choice : Users trust known neighbourhood agents and choice to pick the
service touch points/agents is key to build trust / inclusion.
5.Automation : Manual steps/processes cause delays, middlemen
Following are few key capabilities to consider to address above challenges:
1.Mobile First : Mobile first approach is to have service delivery enabled using
mobile devices like phones, tablets, laptops. Ideally build once and deployed
across operating system platforms is encouraged to keep the IT systems lean.
2.Online/Offline : Mobile device based delivery enables local secure storage to
strategise processes for offline delivery when online services are not reachable
due to network connectivity/coverage. System processes can be dictated to
grant device level online/offline policies based on local context.
3.Smart Synchronization: Offline service delivery requires required master,
reference and recent transactional data available for taking minimum required
business validations.
4.Self/Assisted : Business processes to be aligned for self and assisted use case
scenarios.
5.Local Face Auth : Face authentication with liveness checks on the edge device
as reusable software library/module across various department apps. This can
act digital rail infrastructure component.
6.Device Registration : All mobile devices enabled to provide self or asssisted
services can be registered to manage granual level of controls to deliver
services in secure and trusted environments.
7.Assisted Operators: All assisted operators enabled to provide assisted services
can be trained and registered to deliver remote services.
Approach

88
1.Face authentication models should be well tested to ensure seamless user
experience to address inclusion. The solution should work in conditions like low
device technical specifications, lighting conditions, ease use, local language
support, integration with business application flows etc.,
2.Face authentication models should be integrated with face liveness detection
process as well.
3.Digital exception management should integrated into the workflows thought
reason codes. Scenarios where face liveness / match, backend service related
errors to be handled through a well thought through exception management
process.
4.Continuous improvements to both technical and business processs should be
considered by analysing the telemetry data from the devices.
Face Autentication using a mobile device opens up an oppurtunity for governments
to serve large number of excluded population with ease.

eKYC/ Identity profile sharing
Every identity system has a few data fields like biometrics, photograph,
demographic details, email id/ mobile number, which in combination identifies each
individual uniquely . For numerous applications, it is essential to authenticate the
user and obtain their profile details from a trusted source. 
KYC involves establishing and verifying a personʼs/ an organizationʼs identity to
assess and monitor customer risk. KYC requirements in most countries mandate
that citizens provide proof of their identity and address. Physically producing and
verifying these documents is expensive at scale because of the high transactional
costs involved, large TATs, and low trust in the system. As a result, countries reach
a point where operational costs around identity verification are a barrier to getting
services to the poor and disadvantaged. 
This creates a need for a process thatʼs not only digital, and instant but also fool-
proof and non-repudiable.  
In ID-based eKYC, identity is verified electronically after which the service provider
can access the profile details of your ID from the ID authority database. Itʼs a value
addition on top of ID-auth and allows an individual to share these profile fields to
any system. 
How does eKYC work?
1.The userʼs identity is verified using ID number and biometric data/ OTP from ID
DB via a service provider (refer to e-Auth)
2.Upon authorisation, the user authorizes the ID authority to release the minimum
required demographic information and photograph (KYC packet) to the
requesting entity via a standard API.
ID-based e-KYC can be built as an independent service that can be seeded with
data for authentication by any ID system. The ID based e-KYC is an extension of
auth; however, a key distinction is that any requesting entity can receive and store
identity profile data.

90
1.Infrastructure, connectivity & coverage: Procurement of any specialized
hardware for authentication can become prohibitively expensive at a national
scale. This and accessibility constraints can impede the delivery of services in
rural, remote areas. 
•
A choice that any government can make in this regard is to allow private players
to become e-auth service providers after adequate training & certification.
Opting to publish all the hardware standards brings market forces into play,
resulting in competitive prices for everyone. 
•
Offline mobile-first authentication can will eliminate the need to procure
expensive hardware.  
2.Data security & privacy: Concerns about the security of data and possible
misuse of the shared information.
•
Itʼs on the government to balance innovation while ensuring that no one has
uncontrolled access to private data.  The concerned government departments
can choose to identify authorized service providers after licensing and testing.
These should be mandated to maintain logs of data access, which can then be
scrutinized by the regulators.
•
A user should also have the ability to revoke access to their KYC data by any
service provider or entity at any time.
Use cases:
•
Financial inclusion via bank account opening
•
KYC for purchase for mobile sims 
•
Securities account opening
•
Enrollment in govt. schemes

Single Sign On (SSO)
Most governments offer a variety of services to their citizens. It is costly and
redundant to have each service provider maintain a separate list of authenticated
users and their passwords.
Single sign-on is an authentication scheme that can be integrated into multiple
applications to allows a user to access services. It enables an user to log in with a
single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.
Having a digital ID-based SSO will drastically simplify the service delivery while
reducing the dependence on 3rd party SSO providers. End users can identify
themselves in order to avail of online services and also share their profile
information. 
ID-based SSO can be connected to any ID that provides a mechanism to
authenticate the users. 
How does this work?
1.The user visits the service provider and chooses to login with ID-based SSO
option
2.The user has to authenticate their identity via any of the provided modes.
3.Upon authentication, the userʼs explicit consent is sought to share profile data
fields. 
4.The service provider can authenticate a userʼs identity against data stored on
any identity system via SSO.
Any ID-based SSO should provide multiple modes of user authentication including
OTP-based, biometrics or even wallet-linked authentication.
Benefits of SSO:

93
1.By providing as a secure, efficient log-in mechanism, ID-based SSO increases
the ease of doing business for individuals and businesses, Along with
increasing digital economic activity, this also presents a potential revenue
stream for the governemnt. 
2.This can be used for consented data sharing of ID profile fields or for eKYC
needs of different applications. An applicationʼs authentication request can also
ask for details needed for profile setup or eKYC compliance, which can be
shared upon explicitly receiving user consent.

QR Code for Offline ID
Best practices design and implementation guide
QR codes are omnipresent and act as a bridge to connect the physical world with
digital. QR codes also help users with minimal or no digital literacy to safely
navigate performing digital transactions such as payments, enrolling into social
programs, proving credentials (such as driving /university/ employment
credentials), sharing resources (like photos/documents/contacts), tracking e-
commerce orders and shipments, etc.,
One of the primary challenges in QR code use is the size of the payload to encode for
easy scan and decode. For online use cases, URLs with reference codes that redirects
to an online service to complete the transaction works well.
This note calls out design, implementation best practices in identity / credential
domain for offline use of QR. These principles hold true for other domains as well.
1.Messages in QR code must be compacted to ensure low / medium priced
mobile phones can easily scan and decode the text. Representing the entire
payload (id/credential data, digital signature and corresponding public key to
verify) in ~2K characters is key to QR code design. 
2.QR code must be capable of digitally verifying the authenticity of the ID
credential.
3.QR code should allow 1:1 face matching of the photo ID / credential with live
person using one or more face matching algorithms. This enables inclusion of
users with no devices or minimal digital literacy to prove identity and to access
digital services with high trust, low cost and low friction (self/assisted, any time,
any where use). 
Context
Design Considerations

95
For high density encoded payload (> ~1.5 KB) format, the other parameters like quality
of print (plain vs glossy paper), lighting conditions and camera quality play a critical
role in successful scan and decode of QR content. 
Based on the above design considerations, CDPI recommends the following design
and implementation guidelines:
Recommendations

96
1.QR codes must be versioned. Version number helps refer to the right QR
schema registry for decoding. This allows evolvability of the QR.
2.Custom format must support scalability built-in for multiple libraries to decode
the QR. Encoding should allow optionality of certain attributes, and capability
to add new attributes that a country would like to incorporate into the QR code. 
3.To digitally verify the authenticity of QR:
a.Design should support more than one cryptographic option for digital
signing to enable reasonable backward and future proofing new techniques.
b.Design should allow key rotation and assume there will be valid QR codes
with different key pairs issued at different time.
c.Make public signing keys available as a registry. All known public signing
keys should be easily referenced using a key ID. This helps in reducing the
QR code size too.
4.To protect sensitive attributes such as permanent IDs, phone number, email ID,
etc., consider designing encryption or one way hashing through user
controlled key as salt. Additionally, consider Secure QR format over regular
QRs.
5.Raw compressed face photo in the QR should work with at least 3 different
face matching algorithm's threshold scores (FRR and FAR) 1 that is acceptable
and meet in overall inclusion strategies. Face image can also be represented as
template/embedding and help in reducing the photo size to few hundred bytes
(~500).
6.End to end testing should be carried out in multiple phases to ensure all
functional and non-functional objectives of the design / specifications are
achieved: 

97
a.Phase-1: Lab testing with synthesised data sets to validate the design,
specs and code. Testing can be through APIs and not necessarily people
involved. Sample size ~10 qr messages, ~5 devices.
b.Phase-2: Controlled team testing with actual people in the office or nearby
location. Sample size ~100 qr messages, ~10 devices, ~1 location.
c.Phase-3: Integrating the solution with actual business application/workflow
and controlled field testing. Sample size ~1000 people, ~100 devices and
~10 locations.
d.Phase-4: Rolling out the above integrated business use case solution within
a region (or country wide) to evaluate end to end solution offering (including
1:1 face matching). Additionally, test the solution against multiple use cases
to get feedback and improve specs/design/solution offering.
e.Phase-5: Formal 1.0 release of specs/solution for the country/region.
Propose specifications with regional and/or global standardisation bodies.
In addition to above technical recommendations, QR code should be popularised
through branding, certification and campaigns.

Data Sharing, Credentials and Models
Can an individual/entity/society use its data for empowerment and improved
services?
In the 21st century, data operates as digital capital. The ability to create value from
data is especially crucial to those individuals, entities, and societies who may be
data-rich even before they are financially rich or healthy.
A DPI approach to data sharing can include the following possible use cases: 
1.The ability to generate verifiable credentials for key certificates/claims in a
digital society and share asynchronously with any requestor (eg. proof of
education; proof of business registration; proof of work experience, proof of
vaccination, etc.)  
2.The ability to share personal data in real-time in a secure, consented manner
bilaterally with a party offering me a service based on the data (eg a health
diagnosis, a loan, a recommendation, etc.)
3.The ability for a society to generate open anonymised datasets to enable
research or trends assessments across various sectors 

99
Additionally, the open anonymised datasets can be used to train and publish open
AI/ML models that can be used to better enable access to services based on data,
e.g. real time language translation models; financial underwriting models; etc. 

100
A primer to personal data sharing
Any interactions in a digital economy create huge swathes of data that if shared
with the right stakeholder, can empower the owner to access a wide range of
services. Globally, a lot of emphasis is placed on “data protection” which is
ensuring that the individualʼs data is protected from unauthorised access. Itʼs useful
to think of data as a modern day currency that can be used to unlock services. This
framing brings about a shift from the model of data protection to data protection &
empowerment where the user is in control of their data (both privately & publicity
held) and can freely share it. Opening up access to personal data, reference data
sets (data used to define and classify other data), anonymised and aggregated data
sets, training data and models also falls under the bucket of data empowerment. 
Personal data sharing can take the form of verifiable credentials sharing or sharing
of granular data with the requestor. 
Broadly, we can identify three types of consented data sharing:
1.Verifiable credentials using e-wallets
2.System-to-system data sharing 
3.Consent-led data sharing using a network

101
1.Verifiable credentials: A verifiable credential is a robust instrument of trust
which is digitally signed, machine-readable and intended to serve as proof to
presenters. Any certificate/ credential can be turned into and presented as a
verifiable credential (for eg; Vaccination certificate, professional license,
education records etc.) Sharing the verifiable credentials to any of the
requesters through a digital wallet or any other means is a form of data sharing.
It is also recommended that data principalʼs consent be captured in this
process. Common examples in healthcare are; sharing vaccination certificates,
sharing of doctorsʼ professional certifications, etc. 
2.System-to-system data sharing: In many cases, thereʼs a need to share per-
collected/ existing data internally (within departments that come under a single
umbrella like the government) or within a group of trusted entities. In this case,
a system-to-system data-sharing process can be put in place without involving
the data principal. Data sharing open APIs and an authorization mechanism to
verify the requestorʼs permission will power this. This architecture should only
be used in a high-trust environment. Common examples are the sharing of
patients' data between two govt. programs etc. (It is strongly recommended to
procure the data principalʼs consent before the data sharing and to notify the
data principal after the transfer.)
3.Consent-led data sharing in a network: In this model, a network facilitates the
exchange of data from the data providers to data users via the data principal
(user). There's no centralised store of data and data flows real-time based on a
request that carries the user's consent as well. The user is wholly in control in
this framework. Three powerful technical building blocks can drive user centric,
consented, real time data sharing, namely  data sharing APIs, sector specific
data schema and consent standard.
Cross-border data sharing 

102
Cross border flows are simplest with user-led methods such as credentials, which
donʼt require issuing parties to have bilateral or multilateral agreements in place
with every possible international verifier of a credential. Instead, any potential
verifying entity of the credential who wishes to access the data can locally verify
the digital signature to access the personal data presented by the user. The
verifying entity should ensure to have access to (and cache with ttl - time to live
settings) trust registries namely - global issuer list, corresponding verification keys
& revocation list and credential data schema to accept credentials with higher trust
and convenience to the presenter.
System-to-system data sharing in cross border use cases can require a slightly
higher level of coordination between government departments, the establishment
of international consent managers, supporting legal or regulatory frameworks,
security clearances (for opening up of API ports) as well as interoperability of
technical systems in order to be successful. 
Federated anonymised data sets can be utilised for cross-border research and
developmental initiatives as well through proper contextualisation of the data.
Please refer here for additional design choices to enable and access federated
anonymised data sets.

103
Data standards
A key tech enabler in data exchange
As systems become more digitized, solving incompatibilities between data in
different systems becomes expensive and time-consuming. A key precursor to
interoperability is a shared understanding of the meaning of data used in
communication. Data standards refer to the guidelines that dictate how data should
be documented and recorded. These standards are essential for the effective
exchange, sharing, and comprehension of data, as they ensure both the syntax
(structure) and the semantics (meaning) of the data are uniform.  By establishing
clear definitions and expected formats for data, data standards facilitate the
creation, sharing, and integration of data. They also play a crucial role in eliminating
uncertainties and inconsistencies in data usage. 
Some examples of data standards are ISO 10962 Classification of Financial
Instruments, ICD 10, LOINC  in healthcare, FI information standards in Account
Aggregator, and many more!
Many of these standards are extendable implying countries can adopt some of
these global standards as a base and contextualize it to suit their local
requirements. 
Any country on the journey of adopting a national standard can use adaptors (to
solve incompatibility issues in the interim) to hasten the process.  As harmonizing
data standards used by all institutions is a behemoth task, multiple data standards
can co-exist as long as they are self-identifying.

104
Verifiable Credentials
Governments interact with the individuals in their country for various purposes - to
offer jobs, subsidies, benefits, contracts and more. Private entities such as banks,
businesses and educational institutions also interact with individuals to deem
eligibility and validity for a number of programs. 
The foundation for any of these processes is to establish the attributes of the
individual by verifying documents to determine their eligibility for services or
benefits. 
In the current scenario, both sectors (public and private) spend considerable
amounts of effort into verifying the authenticity of the individualʼs data, with no
guarantee of success. Mistakes can be costly - with large sums of money and
opportunities not reaching the intended people. They can also be dangerous - with
unverified individualʼs gaining access to sensitive systems and processes.
Digitally verifiable credentials, a simple, marginal improvement to existing systems,
built using a Digital Public Infrastructure approach can solve this problem at scale. 
Read more on CDPI's VCs knowledge base
Any issuing authority (whether they are issuing national identity, school
certifications, income certificates, recommendation letters, driving licences, tax
identity, etc) can make their certificates tamper proof while retaining full autonomy
over it. 
Background
What are verifiable credentials? 

105
Paper Certificates can contain a digitally signed online / offline QR code that
connects the paper based document to an official server and fetches the original
certificate for verification. The soft copies of the certificates can be digitally signed
to add an extra layer of security guaranteeing authenticity. 
In this method, no centralisation is required. It allows various departments to retain
control over their certificates, and prevents single storage databases that
inadvertently become the target of cyber attacks as well as leakages. 
The application programming interfaces (APIs) of different issuing authorities are
opened up to create a real time data fetch between systems. Data is fetched (but
not stored) based on API calls made from one system to another asking to validate
a particular piece of data based on the individualʼs consent. Any data issuing
authority and any data-consuming authority can link to the same network by
connecting their APIs and clearing their own verification as per the guidelines
issued by the country.  
Data should only be verified based on an individualʼs consent. As with all DPIs, the
person should be at the centre of the infrastructure.  
An individual can specify the data he wants verified, the party he wants to share it
with, and the period of time he wants to share it for. The consent is granular,
purpose specific (eg for a loan or benefit), simple to understand, and revocable. 
There can be three broad modes of data sharing: 
1.Consent and data are shared at the same time through the same platform: In this
model, the interface itself (wallets or e-lockers) obtain user consent through
their platform and share the data immediately. For example, digilocker in India 
a) Wallets: In digital wallets, users can provide their consent to fetch their digitally
signed documents from various entities. These documents are stored on the userʼs
dashboard and can be shown to anyone. They empower the individual by giving
them control over all their verified credentials. 
How does it work? 

106
b) e-Lockers: In this, the documents are not stored on any dashboard. When the
user provides consent, these documents can be fetched from the provider and
displayed to the user or the data-consumer he provides his consent to. These
eLockers are managed by one or more entities in the country and allow federation
of verifiable credentials. 
2.Consent and data are shared separately and managed through different entities:
In this model, the consent is managed through a third-party intermediary known
as a consent manager. These entities obtain user consent as per the consent
artefact specified and communicate that to data-providers who then separately
share that data to the data-consumers. For example, the Account Aggregator
ecosystem in India. 
3.Consent is managed through the data provider: In this model, data is shared
between two entities such as two government departments without the
individual being directly involved (though ultimately for the individualʼs benefit).
Consent is provided by the data-provider itself at the time of sharing the data.
There are many examples of this DPI: 
Singpass in Singapore is now working to issue credentials fetched by the
Singpass ID. The EU has recently published digital wallet specifications; Argentina
has verifiable credentials as does India, the Open Wallet Foundation strongly drives
the portable identity and credentials agenda. Some US states also accept ISO
standard mDL (mobile drivers license) credentials (eg California).
Opening up APIs also allows for multiple market players to build direct and indirect
products over it. For example, various user-facing applications can be developed,
focusing on different target groups, languages, purposes etc. that allow people to
seamlessly provide consent (according to a consent artefact specified) to have
their data fetched and shared with third parties. 
Verifiable credentials empower individuals and institutions alike; they enable people
to own their data and allow institutions to focus on delivering last-mile services on
the basis of that data. 
Benefits: 

107
It is only when we can easily know about each individual that we can effectively
build for each individual.

Building Data Analytics Pipelines
Imagine youʼre a technical analyst or decision-maker wanting to better understand
and predict regional migration flows. For that, you would need to collect and
integrate anonymized data from different national open portals and internal
management systems to generate regional data intelligence.
What would you need to consider in your data analytics architecture? This exact
question we got asked by an international cooperation agency. Here are some
insights from that exchange, that can be extrapolated to any other data
management initiative.
When it comes to sharing data, the approach varies by region. Some adhere to
open data policies, allowing for the free distribution of datasets, while others might
implement additional controls based on data sensitivity. 
The architecture for processing these datasets typically involves data pipelines,
which can be custom-built, adopted from open-source projects, or sourced from
licensed solutions.
With anonymized datasets readily available through open portals the orchestration
of technical actions to process data in real time becomes the main challenge. This
is what we call the Data Value Chain. More specifically, these are the techniques
youʼd need to put in place: 
1.Data ingestion: Collecting data from various sources.
2.Data clean-up: Removing inaccuracies or irrelevant information.
3.Data transformation: Converting data into a suitable format for analysis.
4.Data Analysis: Analyzing data to derive insights.
5.Storage: Keeping data in databases or storage systems.
6.Querying: Retrieving specific data from storage.
7.Visualization: Representing data graphically for easier interpretation.
8.Sharing: Distributing data or insights to relevant stakeholders.

109
Furthermore, you should implement technical mechanisms for data validation
(ensuring data quality and accuracy) and data security (protecting data from
unauthorized access) at every process step.
Open source technologies play a critical role here, offering robust solutions built on
proven software stacks designed to address such complex use cases.
An open-source tool we often ask countries to reference is Obsrv, by Sunbird,
which processes up to 2 billion events per day at peak. Itʼs built to operate with the
highest levels of reliability with bare minimum operations effort at scale.
The functionality and user experience of open-source solutions are typically highly
customizable and depend on the specific requirements and desired level of
automation of the project. These aspects are context-specific to each project's
objectives.
To gain a comprehensive understanding of this domain, one must consider several
key factors:
1.Hosting options for the data, such as portals, websites, or servers.
2.Data sharing methods, including protocols, APIs, and file formats.
3.Data representation standards and schemas.
4.Data processing mechanisms, like pipelines and ETL tools.
5.Data analysis techniques.
6.Data presentation and visualization tools.
Initiatives like India's open data portal exemplify how to facilitate data hosting,
sharing, and standardization. Platforms like X-road offer a trusted network for more
secure personal data exchanges between govt departments. Solutions like Obsrv
provide an integrated approach to data processing, analysis, and presentation.

110
Understanding these components is vital for anyone looking to delve into the
specifics of data intelligence and analytics, especially in contexts as dynamic and
impactful as regional migration. The journey from raw data to actionable insights is
complex but achievable with the right tools and strategies. Data-driven strategies
empower organizations to make well-informed decisions, enhance user
experiences through personalized services, and employ predictive analytics for
foresight into trends and behaviours.

111
eLockers
A powerful intervention to scale up trusted digital credentials across the ecosystem
Imagine a person, A, who needs to apply for a government job. She travels to a
metropolitan city Y to look for jobs while her documents are still safely back home
in town X. In a world without an e-locker the entire process from securing
documents to securing a job could involve the following: 
1.She will have to locate the original documents right from birth certificate to
identity proof to college marksheets. To do so, she will either have to travel
back herself (spending essential time and money) or ask someone to send them
to her (risking loss or damage through courier). 
2.These documents may have been misplaced over the years due to misfortune
or carelessness. The process of reapplying for them could take months. If she
tries to apply through an agent to expedite the process, it can open the gates to
corruption and misuse of her documentation.  
3.Once the documents have been secured and submitted, the onus will now be on
the agency to verify all information - not just hers but for the thousands of
applications who have applied to fill in the few vacancies. It will be a massive
undertaking of labour, money and time involving paper storage, manual
verification and audits. The chances of fraud through misuse of anotherʼs
documents or false modification of their own will also always be high. 
Multiple organisations face similar challenges for the dispersal of essential services
and opportunities to the public. The process of verification - of ensuring that
someone is who they say they are is extensive and exhaustive; at least it used to be
... before an e-locker.

Why is an e-locker essential? 
What is an e-locker? 

112
An e-locker is an online, verifiable, digital locker App where various government
issued and approved documents are stored. An e-locker provides the following
services: 
1.Anytime Anywhere Access: to all documents in a secure, tamper-evident way
(through digital signatures and time stamps). Any agency (government, private
or public) can apply to issue or receive documents through an e-locker. They
have to be approved by the government to be issuers, and by the individuals to
be receivers of their documents. 
2.Authentication: of all documents, pre-verified, at par with physical original
copies. The e-locker can be built on top of a national ID that can uniquely
identify every individual to connect them with their data using multifactor
authentication based log-in, or allow log in based on a mobile number or other
verifiable identifier  
3.Data Exchange: granular consent (for a specific time period and purpose) based
exchange of documents in machine readable formats for low cost software
evaluations of data (such as those offered by a lending algorithm or shortlisting
people for jobs) 
An e-locker is based on the following principles: 

113
1.Decentralised control, consent-first approach - it fetches the data from a
variety of organisations based on real time user consent and the unique
document or individual ID number instead of storing it in a centralised database.
2.High-trust, low risk - it can use the highest government level security systems
such as multi factor authentication, 2048 bit RSA SSL encryption, ISO 27001
certified data housing, security audits and more, to build a layer of trust
between all parties and eliminate fraud. The documents are also protected and
guaranteed under the Indian IT Act. 
3.Paperless power sharing - it steers the cumbersome, paper and labour heavy,
governance systems to a digital era and allows equitable distribution of power
among individuals from all income, educational and societal levels. It is able to
do so by providing multiple options for organisations to integrate and for people
to come onboard the system depending on their own technical capabilities. The
goal of DPI is to decrease the digital divide by connecting with them at their
level while raising them up to a common standard.   
4.Many apps, many certificates - Well designed eLockers should have open APIs
for issuers of documents and requestors of documents to power multiple apps
to access the credentials based on an open network approach 
In a world with an e-locker, A would have all her documents stored on her
smartphone for easy access and sharing. Within a day, she could apply, be verified,
selected, and employed by any agency. 
Another urgent use-case for an e-locker was storing and verifying an individual's
vaccination certificates during the Covid-19 pandemic. The use of e-lockers during
this period also demonstrated how easy it would be to store all certifications and
documents right from business licence/ registration, to proof of academic history
and employment history, to land ownership, individual identity and more. 
By creating a uniform system for retrieval of documents (while keeping storage of
data still decentralised) through an e-locker, a government can: 
How does implementing an e-locker benefit a country? 

114
1.Stimulate the countryʼs digital economy across sectors (financial institutions,
employers, healthcare providers, social sector workers) by providing
verification of individualsʼ documents. Large scale adoptions of DPI such as e-
lockers also builds public trust in technologies and triggers new innovation in
trusted digital services. 
2.Build inclusive systems and structures by eliminating the time, effort, cost gaps
that often dominate the availment of opportunities such disbursement of health,
financial and social services and leave the last mile population behind 
3.Reduce corruption and exploitation by building high-trust systems for the
vulnerable sections of society who lack the knowledge and tech-savviness to
use private, paid providers (who may not be recognised under the countryʼs IT
Act anyway) 
4.Make it convenient for multiple local, provincial, state, or national departments
to provide digitally signed quality digital documents It allows any department to
issue digitally signed machine readable credentials without purchasing their
own signing infrastructure while still retaining control over the documents they
issue. 
5.Allow organic and asynchronous digital growth in a society by letting different
organisations integrate with an e-locker at their own pace.. 
In India, an MSME portal, Udyam, was able to integrate and issue their existing
certifications for small businesses through e-lockers in just three weeks! 
How does an e-locker work? Tech overview of the
system

115
1.Type of DPI: Data Sharing & Models
2.There are 3 parties to any interaction: the issuer of documentation, the
individual and the requester of documentation. 
3.Issuers upload groups of verified documents in various repositories, and
individuals can upload their own documents self-attested in personal e-lockers.
Requesters can ask for information from either place. 
4.All information can communicate with each other and pass freely in the system
because it complies with DLTS specifications, has unique document URIs and
authentication using strongly verifiable identity
5.When the requester asks for a particular document, it is passed on to the
individual who provides a URI of either a repository or their e-locker. Requester
uses DLTS Gateway API to access the document based on the URI. This API call
may need one more step of consent verification from the individual. 
6.The gateway provider will map the URI to an actual URL to draw out the actual
documentation and send it back to the requester. Authentication and time-
stamping will be automatically conducted both ways (from gateway to
repository and back). Anonymised audit logs will be stored by the gateway and
the repository provider. This completes the process.
7.The e-locker has 2 published sets of open APIs - one for the requestor and one
for the issuer. 
8.You can also open APIs in any e-locker app so that any application can fetch the
credentials in the future (not just the official e-locker application) as long as you
have verifiable identity that used to log in.

Non-personal Anonymised Datasets
Guidelines for for Decision Making & Research
Background
Publicly available anonymized datasets are collections of data that have undergone
a process of data anonymization, which preserves the analytical and research value
of data while maintaining the anonymity of any data subjects. The purpose of this
process is to protect individuals' privacy by removing personally identifiable
information (PII), such as names, addresses, and social security numbers, while still
making available data containing important insights for policy, administrative,
research or trends assessments across various sectors. Non-personal data
includes the above as well as data that had no personal information to begin with
(such as public GIS location, regional/national socio-economic indicators, weather
or aggregated tax collections. ).
These datasets can be made freely available to the public to encourage innovation,
promote transparency, or assist in scientific research. For example, public
anonymized datasets can be useful in training machine learning (ML) models,
analysing aggregated health data to understand disease patterns, devising
informed care plans, and designing clinical trials for drug development. They
facilitate algorithm training without privacy breaches, inform healthcare strategies,
optimise trial protocols, and expedite drug discovery while upholding privacy and
ethical standards.
To ensure success at scale, it is important to note that a centralised approach to
aggregated datasets may be difficult to scale since every entity will be required to
upload their datasets onto a single platform and they may be hesitant to part with
their data. Even if they do share their data, ensuring it is regularly updated and
synced to the main system would be an uphill task. A simpler approach is to create
an open network policy for anonymised data sharing. Entities can engage the help
of any technology provider and join the network to share their data under their own
brand. This would give them recognition and control over their own datasets and
make it easier to keep it updated over the long term. The choice on whether the
data would be freely available at a cost could be a policy decision and the network
would support both models. 

117
1.Federation by design: Rather than striving for a single centralised data
repository covering all relevant data for the sector, it may be more pragmatic to
continue to foster an ecosystem where multiple such datasets and data
providers exist (even across multiple portals/platforms) each contributing to a
broader pool of knowledge available to multiple innovators. It's crucial to note
that harmonising the data schemas across all units isn't necessarily required -
as long as each data publishing entity publishes the data schema used by their
data set. 
2.Privacy by design to protect individual identity at all times: Small data sets
require special attention when sharing aggregated results to ensure de-
anonymisation is not possible.
3.Open Access: It is key to ensure that each dataset is made available openly for
others to leverage and reuse effectively through transparent policies. 
4.Open Standards: Promoting open standards for data sharing is key to enabling
ease of reuse by software algorithms that access and analyse data. Open data
schemas and apiʼs facilitate seamless access to data from multiple sources. 
Accessing data is also a set of services that can be facilitated by APIs as per a
standardised protocol for ‘discovery and fulfilmentʼ of any good or service. A
decentralised “non-personal data access network” designed to facilitate access
based on unified standards via a protocol such as Beckn can enable, as per
standard APIs, the following data access services: 
1. Discovery of various types of data sets across various agencies/entities
(public/private). 
2. Licensing/Contracting: data set licence conditions vary and both parties should
contract before download/access.
3. Download/Access: Access methods range from dataset downloads to data-as-
a-service models employing confidential computing. Advanced computing methods
may establish data sandboxes instead of straightforward availability to enable deep
learning networks for model training.
Design Principles for crafting open data sets 
Decentralised non-personal data network

118
4. Pricing: While some data may be freely accessible, not all datasets are public or
free. Public data is typically expected to be freely accessible but with certain
analytics can also be made available at a price point. Pricing enables transparency
for all players to make informed decisions and a sustainable ecosystem.
5. Update/Feedback cycles: Implementing automatic dataset update notifications
ensures timely feedback cycles (for example yearly), enhancing data relevance
over time
All of these processes occur across diverse agencies publishing data
product/service catalogues within a decentralised network. This is crucial for
ensuring that both public and private datasets are accessible within a unified
decentralised framework. 
The aforementioned architecture pertains to non-personal data (NPD) across public
and private systems, whether through download/access or confidential computing
models. All operations are decentralised, allowing data set services to be managed
and updated by agencies worldwide.

Note: 
Personal data sharing is not in the scope of this document. Personal and Non-
personal data sharing require two different approaches across architecture, policy
and governance frameworks.
Consent to opt in to share data for anonymisation is assumed to be part of the data
sharing governance / policies of the source systems/platforms/entities and is
outside scope of this document.

Trust Infra
Can I assert in a tamper proof manner that X item was agreed by and/or came from
source Y?
Three key components make up this DPI category: 
1.Digital Signatures or PKI: To ensure a document/certificate/data packet hasn't
been tampered with, a nation needs to generate the capability to affix a
verifiable digital signature.  
2.eSignatures: The ability of an individual or entity to electronically sign a
document digitally (via mobile) to indicate agreement 
3.Granular Consent: The ability of an individual to indicate their consent to share
data for a specific purpose and time period with an indicated third party, and
generate an auditable and digitally signed consent artefact to indicate that
intent.  

120
Digital Signatures and PKI
Digital signatures are cryptographic mechanisms used to verify the authenticity and
integrity of electronic data. In healthcare, where the accuracy and confidentiality of
information are paramount, they play a crucial role in ensuring electronic records
remain trustworthy. 
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is at the heart of digital signatures. 
1.Key Pairs: PKI uses two related cryptographic keys: a private key (kept secret
by the owner) and a public key (shared openly).
2.Signing: When data needs to be signed, the owner's private key is used to
generate a unique digital signature for that data. This process often involves
creating a hash of the data and encrypting it using the private key.
3.Verification: Anyone can verify the signature using the corresponding public
key. They decrypt the signature to retrieve the original hash and compare it
against a new hash of the received data. If they match, the data is unchanged
and verified.
While individuals and organizations are common entities using digital signatures,
non-human entities like websites, servers, or software can also use them.
Digital Certificates for Websites: Websites use digital certificates to establish secure
(HTTPS) connections. The website's certificate, which contains its public key and
has been digitally signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), is provided to visitors. This
assures visitors they're interacting with a genuine website, not a malicious
impersonator.
Data Fields: Individual data fields within larger datasets can be digitally signed,
ensuring the integrity of specific pieces of information within broader systems (eg:
registries)

121
eConsent
In any sector, the stream of personal data generated during every transaction
enables better decision-making and service delivery. Itʼs imperative to empower
users by enabling consented sharing of granular personal data in a secure, privacy-
protected manner. In any user-driven data-sharing framework, the data consumer
needs to request the user for their personal data by specifying the quantum of data
required, the purpose itʼs going to be used for, the duration the data is needed for,
the frequency of data pull etc. This step is a precursor to the actual sharing of data
by the data provider. Maintaining logs of the agreed-upon data-sharing transaction
in a non-repudiable, auditable fashion is a key check. 
Electronic consent is an artefact/ data structure that records and stores the consent
for that data-sharing agreement. Technically, it is a machine-readable electronic
document that specifies the parameters and scope of data share that a user
consents to in any data sharing transaction. 
The consent artefact in general consists of the following sections:
1.Identifier section: Identifies and lists all the entities involved in a data-sharing
transaction; the data provider, the data consumer, the individual, and any other
intermediary
2.Data section: This section describes the type of data & permissions of the data
being accessed including the data fields, date range of data, duration of access,
frequency of access, etc. The purpose for which the data is to be accessed
should be clearly defined as well. 
3.Signatures: Each consent artefact should include a signature block with
signatures of one or more entities as defined in the framework
The electronic consent framework should be programmable, i.e should allow for
condition based consent approval with required checks. (eg: Automatic consent
approval for access to blood group, allergies, etc, in an emergency)

122
eSign
eSignatures can be built as a capability on top of any identity system. They allow
for an individual to avoid a physical or wet signature, and instead sign a document
remotely using a method of identity authentication. These documents could include
loan agreements, property ownership agreements, or closure of business
documents for instance. 
eSignature is a protocol that can allow an ecosystem of electronic signature
providers to facilitate legally valid signatures as a service to various public and
private institutions, typically building on an existing identity authentication and
eKYC API. 
An example eSign ecosystem could be architected as follows:

Discovery & Fulfilment
Accessing any goods or services interoperably via any app/interface
A DPI approach to Discovery and Fulfilment represents the capability to avail of any
service or purchase any good across multiple apps in an interoperable manner. This
can include: 
1.Open APIs for government services such as tax filing or business registration
2.A shared protocol for purchase of goods or services across sectors (such as 
BeckN) including for use cases such as:
a.Open Mobility/Transport: using any one app or interface, book railways,
flights, buses, or cabs interoperably. 
b.Open eCommerce: Buyers and sellers can search any app to view a catalog
and place an order for an item, and aren't restricted to just one two sided
marketplace app
c.Open Financial Services: Allows borrowers to view and apply for
loans/insurance products from multiple banks/insurers in any app on the
network.

124
Platforms to Protocols
Why do we need open networks?
Consider this - Buber is the leading ride-hailing app in country A. Buber takes a
huge commission from the drivers and also charges the passenger unfairly. Still,
both parties are left with no choice but to use Buber due to strong network effects
from the aggregation of a large number of drivers and passengers - creating a
virtual monopoly. Sounds familar? Read on!
With every passing day, more and more services are becoming digital, often
powered by private platforms that have disrupted traditional service providers.
Strong network effects and hence concentration of data with these few large
players is a pattern we see. Closed-loop marketplaces are the norm. Apps are not
interoperable and all the individual businesses have to solve all parts of the
transaction cycle, i.e. - discovery, ordering, fulfillment & post fulfillment. 
While an aggregator-led model (where both service providers and end users are
onboarded to the same platform) seems to work, it does not scale beyond a point.
Besides, large aggregators often adopt business policies that are advantageous to
neither the service provider nor the end user. 
Data in siloes, predatory monopolistic practices, lack of scale, and exclusion of
certain population segments - all indicate a need to shift the approach from
“platform” to “networks”. Imagine trusted, low-cost, decentralized transactions at
scale - this is what open networks aim to achieve!

Payments
P2P, P2M, B2B, G2P, and P2G.
Payments are the lifeblood of an economy. Without frictionless and low cost digital
payments, commerce is bottlenecked. When payments are largely cash-based
without viable digital alternatives,
1.Remote commerce and eCommerce suffers (particularly in the face of physical
restrictions or remoteness barriers such as those imposed by COVID); and 
2.Physical commerce faces higher frictions and challenges (loss of value due to
lack of availability of exact change, increased likelihood of robberies/theft, etc).
While digital payments are not new, a DPI approach is distinct from existing types of
digital payments in it they creates inclusion, innovation, and unprecedented scale
of access that allows for diverse user experiences (over smartphone, feature
phones, or no-phones). 
To ask whether the payments in your country is operating as a Digital Public
Infrastructure, simply answer this: is a majority of the population in my country,
(particularly those of lower incomes) able to access and regularly use a reliable
means of digital payment at affordable cost to them? If not, and a payments system
is used only by the elite sections of a country while much of the population
prefers/relies on cash, there is scope in your country for a DPI transformation in
payments that could catalyse the digital economy. 
In particular, we explore 5 powerful payments interventions to trigger a DPI
transformation: 
1.Interoperable QR Code (P2P/P2M Payments)
2.Interoperable Authentication (P2P/P2M Payments)
3.Financial Address Mapper (G2P Social Benefit/Cash transfer Payments) 
4.Cash in Cash Out (CiCO) for Interoperable agents in cash withdrawal
5.Interoperable bill payments protocol

126
All types of transactions - whether between people, businesses, and / or
government - can be powered by the same protocol that allows for interoperable
payments! The protocol is agnostic to payment device, currency, type of
transaction etc.
a protocol which is agnostic ...
... powers payments which are interoperable! 

127
Financial Address
Normalised financial address for payments
Just the way ‘21/02, House X, Street Y, City Z, Postcode - 000ʼ is your home
address (where you stay), the combination of ‘Bank A/c No., Code, Bank Name +
Branchʼ or “Card number, Provider, Expiry, CVV” etc. is your financial address
(where your money stays). 
A few decades ago, the only way to meet people at home was by giving them your
home address and inviting them over. So people had smaller friend circles and
fewer people in their lives.  Soon, Google Maps simplified an entire address to a
single, shareable URL which allowed people to have a quick, efficient way of getting
their address out. Then email addresses, instagram handles, linkedin profiles and
multiple other channels of discovery came along encouraging new connections.
Peopleʼs social lives exploded, and the world as we know it transformed. 
The same is now happening in the financial world for payments through the
concept and implementation of a “financial address”.  
A financial address is a system that (i) encourages people to transact digitally, from
any store of value, to any store of value, while completely preserving (ii) the privacy
of the payer/payee and (iii) the trust of the receiver. 
A financial address simplifies any store of value to a unique address in the form of
“id-type:id@provider”. For example,  “mobile:12345@mobile-pymt”
(mobile@mobile-provider)  or 
“account:12345@national-bank” (account-id@bank-psp-code) 
Concept

128
Through this, the payment systems know which account to transfer the money to,
while hiding these details from the human and machine eye. It creates a routing
mechanism that ensures secure transfer of money, while eliminating the chances of
fraud, misuse, or leakages through hacking. The resolution of the final store of
value account is left to the final entities doing debit/credit actions of the payment.
1.Protects privacy of users encouraging them to transact with various parties
freely and safely 
2.Enhances cybersecurity by preventing the creation of honeypots (large
databases with sensitive financial data that can be hacked or leaked) 
3.Allows multiple, and ever evolving, stores of value to be conveniently
communicated in a standard format 
4.Builds P2P and P2M trust - spurring innovation and adoption. 
The financial world is continually evolving with new products and offerings to
customers. 
1.Traditionally bank accounts were identified with customer account number,
bank id, bank branch. Overtime, with evolution of  mobile and net banking the
identifiers have evolved where the branch id is no longer relevant and this got
encapsulated with in mobile number/identifier and net banking customer id
respectively.
2.With card based networks/accounts, product offering with debit, credit, gift,
pre-paid cards the attributes to identify a store of value account keeps
changing. e.g., card type, varying length of card number, card type, expiry
year/month, cvv, one time tokens, etc.,
3.Digital cash and Crypto cash concepts are continuing to evolve.
Advantages 
Why Financial Address?

129
In these scenarios, defining a store of value account using a fixed key/value or
object structure will not be intuitive and core payment api specifications need to be
constantly updated with each new product offering coming into market.
The idea of normative addressing format to represent any store of value account is
referred to as financial address (fa). Any payer or payee accounts now can be
abstracted to a normative address and resolution of final store of value account is
left to the final entities doing debit/credit actions of the payment.
On similar lines, to enable integration with various identity systems/registries of all
customer ids can also be represented in normative addressing formats!
1.Financial address is case insensitive normative representation of a store of
value account represented as id-type:id@provider
2.id-type can be a account num, customer id, user id, virtual id, unique id, one
time token, pre-paid voucher no, cdbc  id, etc.,
3.The resolution of final store of value details is left to the entity holding these
accounts at final debit/credit left of the payment transactions.
4.id-type & provider information in financial address shall enable intermediaries in
the payment network to route the payment instructions as per the network
rules/polices.

Interoperable QR Code
P2P, P2M, Recurring/Bill Payments, etc.,
Overview
Imagine a one-stop feature that your country can build to bridge the digital divide,
drive financial inclusion to the last mile, break payments silos, drive e-commerce
and GDP, reduce financial crime rates, and spur cross-sectoral innovation - all
whilst leveraging existing systems.
Payments made based on an interoperable Quick Response (QR) code standard
allow people to make payments to anyone, anytime, and anywhere. Payments can
be made in a real-time, and highly secure manner with this digital public
infrastructure that allows people to scan a machine readable QR code through any
payment application of their choice on their mobile, regardless of which payment
app the merchant uses. 
QR codes can be made interoperable if a standard is set out by a central authority,
and can allow a user to participate in a single network of banks, financial
institutions, mobile money, wallets, or other payment mechanisms on the backend.
This can be a simple and powerful addition to existing payments systems. 
QR Codes can be of two types: 
Traditional approach of 'digitisation' breeds
exclusion
The DPI approach guarantees inclusion +
market participation

132
1.Static QR Codes: Bill amount has to be manually entered - it is a single code and
can be printed as it does not change with each transaction. 
2.Dynamic QR Codes: Transaction amount is pre-entered by the merchant by
connecting it to a PoS terminal. 
Through Interoperable QR Codes: 
1.Countries can facilitate seamless payments such as P2P, P2B, P2M and various
other entities 
2.Merchants can automate the reconciliation of orders and payments, as well as
generate receipts and notifications by integrating with existing accounting
platforms. 
3.Individuals can set up Recurring payments, Bill Payments etc.,
4.The last mile population can be catered to, and raised to the same level of
financial inclusion through digital transformation.
5.The rate of fraud will drop, while increasing privacy, security, transparency and
trust across the ecosystem.

Interoperable Authentication
P2P, P2M
When we speak about ‘authenticationʼ, we are referring to the ‘knowledge layerʼ.
Authentication means the confirmation - of the person as well as transaction.
Interoperable, in this context, means standardised. Thus, interoperable
authentication means the ability to confirm the transaction in a standardised
manner. 
As an economy grows, very often through the nudge provided by the DPI approach,
a lot of new fintechs emerge in the market. They offer a variety of services like
banks do - such as P2P/P2M payments, loans, bill payments etc. However, they
have one stark difference - they are unregulated. This gives them the agility the
banks lack to adapt to newer trends and technologies but the unpredictability and
volatility of creating systemic risk. Restricting their growth means stumping
entrepreneurship and the economy. But letting them run freely, means more money
leaving the formal banking system and going into unregulated hands. The solution
to preventing both these extremes lies in interoperable authentication. 
Through interoperable authentication, the central bank can set out a predefined
manner in which transactions have to be validated to ensure that money never
leaves the banking system. The payment transaction is processed only once the
authentication is received in a standardised manner in the form of a PIN, One time
password, biometrics, face authentication etc. The fintechs remain the front end of
the user-transaction, but the authentication is collected by the payment switch
directly on the backend and settled between the banks themselves. 
This solves for both use cases - it prevents money from leaving the formal banking
system (goal of the banks) and it prevents users from leaving the fintech
application to authenticate themselves (goal of the fintechs). 
Why: 
What: 

140
The authentication page is provided as a standard SDK (software development kit)
by the payment switch operator. They publish the page that all fintechs have to use,
effectively decoupling this layer from the acquiring application to securely capture
sensitive info like PIN, OTP, Biometric data with crypto keys for end financial
institution to decrypt and authorise the payment. This SDK is integrated within all
fintechs themselves so that while authentication is done on their application, it is
done without the oversight of the fintechs. This SDK is mandated and has to be
used by every payment application (including the banks themselves). 
This creates 3 distinct layers, and thus roles, to every payment transaction: 
1.User layer: handled by fintechs who can create diverse, custom user interfaces
to grow their market share 
2.Authentication layer: handled by the payment switch to securely capture private
PIN, OTP, Biometric data and verify each transaction 
3.Settlement layer: handled by the banks themselves and settled between each
other directly on the backend 
1.Privacy and Security: Enhances trust by allowing individuals to have a
standardised experience while authenticating sensitive information and
payment transactions across different applications 
2.Reduces systemic risk: by decoupling the verification process from the fintechs,
it prevents misuse or leakage of secure pins, password and biometric data 
3.Growth of formal economy: it allows the free economy to grow and thrive with
the growth of fintechs while ensuring the money never leaves the formal,
regulated sector

Interoperable Bill Payments
Streamlining the process of bill payments across authorities and departments
Individuals have to pay multiple bills on a monthly basis - electricity, water, loan
EMIs, mobile recharge etc. Keeping track of all individual due dates, navigating
complex standalone portals and making payments for each is a difficult, time-
consuming process. Often, this leads to an increase in missed payments, defaults,
and subsequently, higher interest rates for individuals and a weaker economy for
the country. 
Centralisation of payments through a single portal is not an option - it will create a
bulky, slow system that is the target of cyber attacks. It will also cause various
departments to lose agency and autonomy over their own collections and create
friction in society. 
Leaving payments integration to private sector players is not an option either -
multiple bill issuers will have to integrate with multiple different applications each,
once again causing high friction, loss of opportunities and a monopolistic situation
for the first mover. 
The only solution lies in establishing interoperable bill payment rails through the
Digital Public Infrastructure approach.
Interoperable bill payments means that people should be able to view and pay all
their bills through a single platform of their choice. 
The bills are federated at the back end, but centralised for user experience. 
Through this, the objectives of all parties are met - 
Why: 
What: 

142
1.Bill issuers: They retain control over their own assets, and can decrease the
costs of their own issuing infrastructure. 
2.Market innovation: It allows a variety of market players to innovate services,
platforms and applications on top of the bill payment rails to cater to diverse
segments of society. 
3.Bill Payers: Individuals now have the freedom of choice, bolstered by the variety
of payment applications available to pay their bills through a single platform.
To make an existing billing infrastructure interoperable, all that is needed is to
simply open up the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) of different bill
issuing authorities. This enables a variety of user-facing applications to ‘fetchʼ the
data from the issuers and present it to the individuals through their platform. 
The individuals can choose to make the payment directly from that same platform
or through any other means such as cash, card or cheques. 
The bill data is simply fetched from the issuing server and not stored with the
individual applications. 
Once the APIs are open, any market player (once it clears the necessary safety
measures set out by the central bank) can use it to fetch data based on individualʼs
consent. There is no need to separately on-board different issuers or platforms over
and over again. 
A variety of financial models can be established on top of this infrastructure. One
common one being, that every time an intermediary fetches a bill for an individual
they charge the bill issuing authority a miniscule amount (0.0x%) of the transaction.
The percentage is laid out by the central bank and same for all intermediaries to
ensure a level playing field. 
How: 
Financial Model: 

143
This money is the cost of convenience for letting the bill be discovered (and hence
paid) by the individual on the application of the individualʼs choice. This cost is
absorbed by the bill issuer and not passed on to the consumer, thus ensuring that
the cost of the bill for the individual across all applications remains standardised. 
1.Federated control: Data continues to be stored on individual servers of issuers
and is only fetched and displayed upon receiving an API call. 
2.Inclusive innovation and Interoperability: The design of the infrastructure allows
for multiple market players to innovate services and platforms on top, while
ensuring no additional work for bill issuers to integrate with diverse systems. 
3.Privacy and security by design: The intermediary applications cannot see,
modify or force transactions. It can simply display the bills based on an
individualʼs consent, who are free to pay through the same application or any
other means of their choice.

Cash in Cash Out (CICO)
Interoperable banking agents, devices for last mile CICO transactions
Typically, the last mile population is overlooked when enabling financial services
through digitisation. Since literacy may be low, access to the formal banking system
can seem intimidating to many. They may get lost trying to navigate the
complexities of modern day banking such as doing online bank transfers or even
checking their balance. Moreover, many local businesses need physical cash - they
do not see much value in digital payments. The old adage reads: Banks cannot go
to every village, it is simply not possible.
Well, banks may not be able to go to villages, but - through the Digital Public
Infrastructure approach - banking can.  
One of the key aspects of financial inclusion and integrating people into the formal
economy is ensuring the last mile population has access to bank accounts.
However, if they donʼt know how to use it, very often these bank accounts remain
idle, and if any benefits are transferred to the account, they remain unreachable for
the masses. 
The cash in - cash out DPI helps solve for last mile access to formal banking
services. 
The cash in - cash out system equips select human beings to function as ‘micro-
ATMsʼ. This means that they travel to remote areas of the country where individuals
can conduct transactions through their bank accounts using the person as a ‘micro-
ATMʼ. The individuals get immediate access to their money while remaining in the
formal financial system. 
Why: 
What: 

145
Cash In: is about securely transferring benefits to end beneficiary by removing
intermediaries and remove friction and cost.
Cash Out: is for providing access to physical cash at the last mile to use the direct
cash benefits payouts.
The cash in - cash out system is based on a unique national identity system.
Basically, the chosen people who are acting as these ‘micro-ATMsʼ travel to the last
mile populations, carrying a certain amount of money with them along with an
authentication device. Any individual can simply provide their bank account name
as well as their national identity number and biometrics to authenticate that
information. Using this, the micro-ATM can pull up their bank information on their
device. 
On the backend, a financial address mapper links every unique national identity
number to an individualʼs bank accounts. Once the bank name is provided by the
individual, it can accurately connect to bank servers, find the match, and pull up
that data for the individual to use. 
Now once again, by providing authentication through their biometrics, individuals
can: 
1.Deposit cash 
2.Withdraw cash (remember, the Micro-ATM is carrying money with them) 
3.Transfer money using only another personʼs national ID number (no bank
account details necessary) 
4.Pay bills 
5.Check bank balance 
6.Generate a mini-statement 
All these facilities are available at no additional cost to the end-users. 
How: 

146
While the micro-ATMs are essentially agents of one particular bank (and receive
their salary from them), they cater to customers of banks across the country
without discrimination. 
The benefit to the banks is that it allows expansion of the society into the formal
financial sector who can avail a variety of services which would have otherwise not
been possible. 
1.Financial inclusion: it caters to the underserved sections of society while
elevating them to the next level by providing them with access and
empowerment through formal finance. 
2.Interoperability: it allows for diverse banks to access the last mile population
and enable national identity based transactions through a central switch and
clearing agency. 
3.Privacy and security: the method of authentication using biometrics is inherently
safe as it cannot be forged or duplicated by the micro-ATMs. The privacy of
individuals is ensured by not revealing any sensitive information and only
enabling basic banking transactions through this facility.

G2P Payments
Increasing efficiency of Government to Person payments
In its daily workings, governments across local, state and national levels make
various payments to people of a country. This may be in the form of subsidies,
pensions, scholarships, incentives during emergencies and more. Citizens may
choose to receive these payments in different ways such as through cash, bank
transfers, mobile wallets, prepaid vouchers, etc. These payments are made across
various departments at different levels of functioning. 
While each transaction may vary in amount or eligibility, there are a few common
steps of executing any g2p payment: 
1.Checking for eligibility of the beneficiaries according to pre-set scheme criteria
using data from federated functional registries
2.Authenticating the identity of the eligible beneficiaries using online/offline,
self/assisted modes
3.Mapping the authenticated, eligible beneficiaries to a store of value of their
choice in which they choose to receive these payments using multiple payment
rails
A G2P DPI is about building an overarching architecture as a simple +1 step to
your existing systems that ensures interoperability, inclusions, privacy, security,
autonomy and asynchronous adoption by design.

148
The Unique ID / eKYC layer allows for uniquely identifying and authenticating each
individual within seconds, saving time + effort + leakages on both sides. 
The Financial address mapper connects an identifier to the individual's store of
value of choice to receive the payments thus facilitating secure transfer of money
to them. 
The last mile agents help those with little to no digital literacy access the same
benefits using their biometric data to drive financial inclusion from the ground up. 
The network of cross functional registries help identify and sort individuals
according to the eligibility criteria of various schemes while keeping the data
decentransiled. It allows for autonomy of departments while building
interconnectivity to drive efficiency. 
There are 4 key building blocks to the DPI approach in solving for G2P 

149
There are few key learnings that make the G2P DPI approach unlike any other: 
This approach has enabled the Govt. of India to rapidly connect to their population of 1B+

DPI advisory
CDPI's individual, customised engagement with countries!
The Centre for DPI is: 
1.Software neutral (we have no product offering of our own and can provide tech
architecture advisory regardless of the software you use) 
2.Technology neutral (we are happy to support countries regardless of whether
they choose open source or private procurement) 
3.Financing neutral (we don't provide funding or take any money for our services,
we are philanthropically funded and work on a pro bono basis) 
4.Government neutral (we are a global team, happy to work with any interested
government and have no political alignment) 
5.Country neutral (our team spans 5 countries, 3 continents, and we work with
global dev partners, tech providers and funders without preference for one over
another) 
At CDPI, we are only biased towards one thing: Implementation!
Whichever country, government, funder, technology and software can help DPI
implementation roll out in accordance with best practices, and fast timelines, we are
happy to support them and work with them to promote global DPI implementation in
the country's best interests. 
CDPI has team members who have rolled out DPI projects at scale in their own
countries, and continues to do so in various contexts (including Daniel Abadie who
oversaw Argentina's verifiable credentials system, Emmanuel Khisa who worked on
ID and Payments in Africa, and Pramod Varma, the chief architect of the India
Stack) 
Any country can approach CDPI (please email info@cdpi.dev) to engage with us.
CDPI can help share some knowledge and insights on the best practices to adopt
while designing their digital transformation journeys to ensure they reach scale in
sustainable manners, power public and private innovation, and are able to create
interoperable, reusable building blocks with minimal funding and resource
constraints. 

153
The engagement with CDPI can be as low-touch or intensive as the country
chooses. Since CDPI doesn't undertake any project management, funding or
software offering, the complete control over the engagement remains with the
country, with CDPI supporting however the country sees fit. 
There are three levels of engagement typically carried out between a country and
CDPI. The engagement can progress from one level to the next as per the country's
interest and progress. 
1.Conversational: Where CDPI informally talks to country representatives to
understand the ecosystem, provide broad guidance on the DPI approach, best
practices, powerful +1s to existing initiatives etc. through virtual calls. 
2.Co-Creation: Where a country chooses to engage with CDPI on a specific use-
case or project to collaborate on a detailed strategy note, align stakeholders,
build out the tech architecture etc. through virtual calls that may be accelerated
through physical visits if required. 
3.Roll-out Action: Where a country is rolling out the DPI pilot or project in line with
the advise received from CDPI and its other stakeholders, and needs continued
support as they reach scale. 
For more information on how CDPI can engage with countries, please feel free to
reach out to us at info@cdpi.dev. To understand how CDPI can provide pre-
packaged DPI product, policy and program management kits for rapid deployment,

DPI as a Packaged Solution (DaaS)
A Transformative but Simple Innovation to Implement DPI with Speed
In many ways, 2023 was labeled as ‘The Year of DPIʼ (at least for those who work in
government, the development sector, or tech-policy institutions!). This year, a
concept relatively new in terminology but fairly mature in global practice was
brought to the forefront as a powerful strategy to accelerate socioeconomic growth.
It was able to not only withstand the scrutiny of top bureaucrats, policy leaders, and
private entrepreneurs across the globe but also fostered a global consensus on the
suggested principles for building DPI - which is a rare feat!
Of course, now that there is consensus on the need to build DPI to accelerate
growth and development, it falls on the executors in countries - how do we build
DPI at an accelerated pace to benefit citizens?
The idea has been explored in this paper - The Future of Digital Public
Infrastructure: A Thesis for Rapid Global Adoption
DaaS - Digital Public Infrastructure as a Service!DaaS - Digital Public Infrastructure as a Service!

155
Why do we need DaaS?
Challenges of Current DPI Implementation that DaaS Seeks to Address
The ground realities of implementation vary not just from country to country, but
also by region. Yet a few common challenges in DPI rollouts persist across contexts:
1.Aninherent friction between need and speed of rollout:the need for the DPI is
urgent for people, but there are often challenges in speed of implementation;
2.Thelocal capacity to architect and build minimalist technology infrastructure
solutions may be low or vary at different levels of government;
3.There may befunding or budget gaps for execution (not just for the new
software systems but also for compute/hardware); and
4.Procurement cycles may be long and tedious to kickstart progress. There are
multiple hoops to jump through before a country can even test out the DPI block
through a pilot. Some of these are shown below, indicating the complexity
countries often face: many have a selection process to identify the team that
would eventually craft the RFP to identify a final system builder. 

156
These execution pains are real!  Often, initial planners are unable to anticipate the
exact system requirements eventually needed in nationwide infrastructure. They
feel the need to anticipate and prepare for all eventualities which is an extremely
time-consuming process and often doesnʼt bear fruit. The future is ever-changing.
The DaaS framing helps to keep the current context in mind while simultaneously
allowing future innovations to be extensible in the future with minimal changes to its
foundational protocols and systems. Creating optionality is a powerful strategy for
large-scale digital projects.
In many countries there is no demonstrated proof of success to show others that
the DPI approach will work at an unprecedented scale - when applied to a specific
use case, in that context, and for those outcomes. A DaaS phase one
implementation rollout can help establish this conviction. 

157
DaaS in a nutshell
DPI as a packaged Solution (DaaS) refers to rapid deployment of DPI, through 
upgrades of existing infrastructure (instead of greenfield implementations) through
non-procurement routes. 
There are multiple operational modules for DaaS: 
1.Benefit from Open Source Artefacts + Funded & Pre trained Service Provider:
Countries can choose to join the funded DaaS program to receive pre-packaged
offerings of their chosen product (digital public goods), and pre-trained service
provider (trained by the digital public good owner) to support deployment, along
with policy frameworks, program management kits, legal templates and costing
models. 
2.Benefit from only Open Source Artefacts: Countries can also choose to reuse
any of the reusable implementation DaaS artefacts to rapidly upgrade their
existing systems to DPI (for example, reusing an eSign module to add
authentication on any ID) using an existing vendor, at their own cost and
according to their own timelines.   
3.Benefit from only Pre-trained Service Provider: Countries can also choose to
deploy an offering from a private pre-existing vendor who has been trained
under the DaaS program by the DPG owner
The reason DaaS stresses on non-procurement is to ensure rapid deployments of
minimalist DPI blocks that can exponentially increase benefits to individuals and
institutions in society - and procurements by governments, while necessary in
some cases, tend to be a year or two long process and are not required for simple
upgrades to existing systems. 
DaaS differs from traditional pilots or POCs because the infrastructure is built for
population-scale from day one using country resources and capacity, and can
reach full coverage in a matter of months. This is supported by the fact that DaaS
applies only to minimalist layers such as authentication on top of existing ID (and
not ID enrolment itself - which even on a best-effort basis would take years to cover
the whole population). 

158
Regardless of whether countries choose to join the funded DaaS cohort or
independently execute DPI blocks, it can be helpful to reuse some standardised DPI
artefacts that can help expedite the process of execution, regardless of the DPI
block chosen, the choice of vendor, or the scale of execution.
DaaS will fast track DPI adoption to any ‘hard to reach areasʼ, applicable beyond
the globalisation effort. 
•    reusable for sub national/state level adoption within any large countries (such as
state level registries) 
•   reusable wherever decentralised private adoption of a module is required (such
as verifiable credentials)

Pre-packaged DaaS kits
The pre-packaged DaaS kits offer an easily deployable model for various DPI
building blocks through packaged product pilots. Through DaaS, you can easily
demonstrate proof of success of the DPI approach for your use case, country,
context, and outcomes - helping build traction for a full-scale rollout.  
The DaaS products significantly reduce the time, cost, and workforce required to
build local, use-case driven DPI. While open-source projects offered by Digital
Public Goods (as shown in the diagram above) reduce the time taken to build core
DPI components, they do not today reduce the time needed for deployment, and
technology management infrastructure. 
DaaS combines best-in-class open-source DPGs with a new class of pre-trained
technology service providers to pre-package DPI for ready deployment for pilots.
In addition to this, it combines program and policy guidance so that the time to
deployment of the DaaS package is further reduced. 

160
DaaS thus leverages best-in-class Digital Public Goods (DPGs) to create a pre-
built package that every country can use to test out a pilot, using a set of pre-
trained Technology Service Providers. Countries retain full control over the pilot
and all systems built (including the IP), and can customise (by adding extensions)
the systems post the pilot and before they scale. 
Countries can also select the type of cloud they prefer - public or private clouds -
to drive growth, inclusion and scale. Private clouds may be more appropriate under
some data protection regulatory frameworks. Countries can also choose to host the
package on-prem if they have the hosting infrastructure. 
DaaS brings together elements that have been a part of digital governments and
national infrastructure building for generations:
DaaS is not very different from what
governments already do today! 

161
1.Cloud (public or private) is not new - it is used for a variety of government
digital services. 
2.Packaged product software purchases are not new - they are part of routine
government operations (such as through the Microsoft suite, Email providers,
etc.) 
3.Open Source DPGs are not new either - multiple governments use open-source
components such as X Road for data sharing or open protocols for best-in-
practice tech principles. 
DaaS is simply a combination of these things - a small
innovation that we believe could have a big impact. 

162
Reusable DaaS Artefacts
Regardless of whether countries choose to join the funded DaaS cohort or
independently execute DPI blocks, it can be helpful to reuse some standardised DPI
artefacts that can help expedite the process of execution, regardless of the DPI
block chosen, the choice of vendor, or the scale of execution. These artefacts are
templates co-created with the larger international DPI ecosystem to standardise the
process of implementation. They can be modified as required to suit a country's
needs. 
These artefacts include: 
1.Execution readiness checklists - helps countries assess their current
infrastructure, map out use-cases and stakeholders, and gain a comprehensive
understanding on some of the pre-requisites to executing DPI in a scalable and
sustainable manner. 
2.Legal arrangement templates - including a draft Letter of Intent between the
country and any open source provider, as well as a back-to-back Memorandum
of Understanding between the open source provider and a service provider that
can support in country deployment, in line with privacy, security and critical DPI
safeguards built in. 
3.Sample costing models - an indicative costing model that reflects the typical
price ranges of a minimalist DPI execution by leveraging an open source
product, irrespective of geography. It also outlines standard team structures
based on the technology and program requirements that can support DPI
execution. The costs represent extensive consultations with multiple
international and local private vendors and open source products across the
world, on a range of DPI blocks, based on their prior experience executing
similar infrastructures in other countries. 
4.Policy kits - sample strategy papers that outline the context, challenges, DPI
recommendations, mechanisms for implementation and benefits that can be
tailored to suit any country and any DPI block for rapid understanding by, and
alignment of, key stakeholders in the country ecosystem. 
5.Program rollout guidelines - highlights the recommended activities that must be
conducted during the pre-assessment, training, build, rollout and scale stages
to ensure that there is adequate local capacity, alignment, and momentum for
the DPI to reach full maturity.

The DaaS Playbook for rapid deployment of DPI pilots has been open sourced and
linked below. 
Design thinking behind the artefacts: 
1.Focused on the country's ability to rapidly execute without recreating
standardised documents  
2.Priorities a country-first impact-first lens by including rigorous privacy and
security measures across all artefacts in line with best practices and global DPI
safeguards 
3.Co-created with an international ecosystem of development partners, open
source providers, private innovators and vendors, and funders for global
accuracy, adaptability and acceptance
4.Agnostic to the type of DPI block built (suitable for all upgrades to existing DPI
and not necessarily all greenfield DPI implementations)

A 3-step process from
idea to implementation!
1.Countries can choose the use case they want to pilot after reviewing the
products on offer
2.Have conversations with CDPI, DPGs, and ecosystem market players to
understand and procure the DPI DaaS package
3.Configure it to their systems and infrastructure with the help of pre-trained
Service providers who can support (along with the DPG) building local capacity
for long term scale and sustainability of the DPI. 
Piloting DPI via DaaS is now a simple 3-step
process! 
How DaaS Solves Speed, Cost, Data
Ownership, and Capacity Constraints

165
The benefits of the DaaS approach are manifold: 
1.Significantly faster rollout
2.Less costly due to minimal upfront costs, smaller teams, and use of open-
source components
3.Clear government ownership of the core IP of the system, data, and cloud
instance
4.Significantly reduced tech capacity requirements 
5.Ability to shift from input (capex) to outcome (opex) based costing (i.e., pay per
user, not for each input cost) 
6.Can help tackle incumbency issues to demonstrate proof of concept as a
convincing argument 
7.Choice of one or more service providers at the same time
8.Choice of clouds and portability 
9.Achieve scale and speed to de-risk churn and changes within the system

Funded DaaS Program overview
Deploy DPI in your country by competitively applying for the Funded DaaS Program
The DaaS program is a competitive application process where countries can make
the case for why they are best suited to quickly implement and scale DPI through
the DaaS module in their own countries. 
The selected countries will be given their DaaS packages as well as
supplementary funding for DPI rollouts by June 2024. The phase one of the DPI
roll-out will be launched in 90 days and sustain for another 90 days (making the
program duration a total of 180 days) to demonstrate sufficient proof of success.
Post the completion of the funded program, the country and DPG can mutually
choose to extend it for more time (or another use case), or start the transition to
scale. 
1.The Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure and EkStep Foundation are joint
convenors of the program
2.The first cohort is being executed in partnership with IIITB/EkStep (as open
source DPG owners depending on the product)
3.Countries undergo an assessment process to ensure they are ready to execute
a time-bound roll-out for higher chances of success.

Co-create with us!
If you are a DPG, SP or ISV looking to scale DPI implementations - partner with us!
We wanted to share some exciting updates with you!
To accelerate the global 50-in-5 DPI Adoption target, the Centre for DPI and
EkStep Foundation are co-convening a program for rapid deployment of DPI pilots
called DaaS. The idea of DaaS or DPI as a Packaged Solution was first introduced
in a paper published by the Carnegie Institute and later put up for discussion at
the Global Technology Summit. The program has been designed after taking
feedback from key development partners, funders, DPGs, and government
agencies. We have published this wiki for a detailed explanation of how DaaS
pilots will be structured. 
In the first edition of the DaaS program, the following products(Digital
Authentication (on top of an existing ID system); Verifiable Credentials; G2P
Financial Address Mapper (ID-Account Mapper); and AI Assistant) are planned to
be made available as packaged, cloud-ready, ready to deploy DPIs for participating
countries based on country demand.
There are around 7-8 implementation-ready countries in the pipeline for current
and upcoming cohorts across Latin America, Africa, and Asia. 
We would like to extend an open invitation to you as DPGs to participate as
partners for the existing packages of products and for future packages of
products. Please let us know if you believe that an open-source project you have
could provide one of the products above. The next products we are anticipating to
add will be Civil and Functional Registries accessible via open APIs. 
Inviting DPG participation for DaaS

186
Your participation will be key to scaling the DPI implementation across countries.
We request you to express your interest in participating by filling out this short form
. You can also share this invite directly to any DPGs you believe is suitable. After
the initial expression of interest, we will organize a virtual webinar to answer
questions and officially onboard DPGs in the DaaS cohorts. 
We anticipate that this model will play a critical role in deploying DPI at scale,
thereby helping us achieve the ambitious goal of 50-in-5. We are thrilled to have
you join us on this exciting and impactful journey. Looking forward!
Regards, 
Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure & EkStep Foundation
We have compiled a DPG readiness checklist for DaaS to help DPGs understand the
requirements to package their products under the DaaS model for rapid deployment by

FAQs on DaaS
A common misconception may be that by participating in a DaaS pilot program, a
country will be giving up complete control over infrastructure that caters to
essential services. However, this is simply not true. Countries retain full control over
the DaaS pilot and they are especially beneficial for short-term pilots demonstrating
proof of success for the DPI approach. 
Common thoughts that may arise  ||  The answer to all is DaaS... 
DaaS is a necessary but not sufficient innovation. It may not solve all technical
capacity or funding problems but is a necessary first step to simplifying DPI
adoption in countries.
Additional FAQs 
Is DaaS only a cloud solution? What if I have data sovereignty and data localisation
concerns with cloud? 
To ensure speed in demonstrating proof of concept and proof of success, we
advise countries to use a private or public Cloud. A cloud like computing
environment makes deployment of DPG packages extremely simple and fast. 

201
However, either way, Cloud is NOT compulsory for DaaS! DaaS can be a non cloud
on-prem environment  as well. The key criteria is for the countries to provision
compute, storage and network infrastructure to quick installation of DaaS
packages. In case of public cloud the opex costs are included in the funding
whereas in case of on-prem hosting, countries are required to provision the infra
and key infra support personnel from the existing setup and are not part of the
funding.
What if I have poor network connectivity and very high data cost for usage of
internet or VPN or leased line?
Like all Digital Public Infrastructure, DaaS solutions too are designed to work for last
mile populations that may have poor network connectivity or high data costs.
Alternate capabilities for users (the way UPI or verifiable credentials that can work
with network, without network (offline), with smartphones, feature phones, voice
based etc), etc. be Depending on the DaaS DPG package, many of these
capabilities are baked into the design itself and can be rolled out by countries as
per their need. 
How much will I save in terms of time and money?  Give me concrete examples.
What if the service providers raise the subscription rates? 
Our hypothesis (based on our work with countries), is that usually it can take up to
24 months to roll out a pilot DPI program since countries have to undergo various
cycles of approvals, definitions, procurement, funding, and build phases. DaaS
approach will bring down this time period to 8-12 weeks (to launch a pilot based on
a pre packaged, pre-templetized DaaS package). 
For the duration of the pilot, if and when a commercial Service Provider (SP) is
involved, their rates can be fixed to avoid custom price discovery and negotiation
by each country. 
Once the pilot is over, the countries can choose to extend the contract with the
same SP who handled their pilot, or switch to another one, depending on the terms
finalised between the two parties independently. 

202
What do I own and what do I not? Is it like renting  a house Vs owning one? 
The country will own all the infrastructure of DaaS. 
This includes the core IP of the underlying open source DPG, and full control
(management and data) of the systems deployed under DaaS pilot. 
It is not like owning vs renting a house. Think of it as building a house from scratch
brick by brick, vs buying a readymade house which you can move into quickly
where the foundations are ready but you can do your own customisations as you
use. 
Is it really so easy? Have you done it before?
It is a plug and play if you select one of the cloud options; however, it will require
some configurations and extensions according to local country contexts, systems
and need. This will be a minimalist effort provided by the Service Provider that goes
into ensuring the ready packaged DPI solutions (DaaS) work in a manner best
suited to your goals.  
None of the concepts of DaaS are new - cloud is frequently used by governments,
as are packaged software solutions, and DPI. They have all individually
demonstrated ample proof of success. DaaS simply combines and harnesses the
power of these existing innovations and infrastructure to enable rapid deployment
of socioeconomic projects. 
Wonʼt we get locked in to cloud service providers like AWS or Azure or google?
How easy is it for me to move from AWS to Azure? Are there are multiple
commercial companies providing same services (like I can switch from uber to ola
for transport).
Since DaaS core packages are fully open source, the possibility of vendor lock-in
issue is minimal. Core DaaS packages are built cloud-neutral and will be tested
across clouds.

203
Moreover, multiple SPs will be offered for each DaaS product category that the
countries can choose and re-choose between as per their need and preference to
create a choice of vendors
When can I see a pilot of (some service), at a sandbox level
DaaS is first being offered as a pilot itself. It is not to immediately scale but rather to
test the concepts for countries to build confidence. For some smaller population
contexts, DaaS could meet the full population needs via a pilot, and provide
flexibility later to probably migrate the system if needed to a different host.
Individual DPGs that are powering DaaS have their own sandboxes. Countries are
free to reach out to them directly to experience their products before experiencing
them through DaaS if so preferred.
Once the use case from a country is known, how long will it take for the "package"
to be ready
The typical steps envisioned are:
1.Install the DPG solution
2.Integrate with the country specific workflow to enable the use case. 
The goal is to have a DPG solution packaged to make the installation possible in
less 8 hours and integration work between 1 to 3 weeks. During this time, the policy
and pilot modalities are worked out in parallel. The current plan is to provide DPI
service to the first user in T+4 weeks. T being the date when the country, svc
provider and DPG owner kick off meeting after signing the MoU.
What "features" will the package have if you imagine a typical G2P use case
In the current release G2P Use case envisioned is only ID to Account Mapper.
Beneficiary & Scheme Management platforms are not planned in this first phase
scope. In an existing G2P flow, Mapper comes handy to pay to a beneficiary using a
functional id.

204
If a svc provider (e.g Deloitte) is spending time/ effort packaging this, how will it
become available to the competition? Or will this package belong to Deloitte and
others will have to build their own?
DPGs are providing the installable package. Deloitte and another svc provider are
consuming it as is. Deloitte is building tech support, proj mgmt unit (PMU) capacity
and coordination with cloud svc providers as part of the DaaS initiative.
In future, Deloitte may add new features on open source offering and provide value
added services to create a competitive landscape.
Does the IP of the package be with the DPG who can allow any other vendor to use
it?
Yes, for the work done and put out by the DPG. For any custom packages (in
future), Svc Providers may be encouraged to use open source licences but not
mandatory. DPGs/Funders may enforce some of these policies. 
What if the country wants to use some other private sector provider for the second
use case of G2P payments (beyond the pilot)?
It is perfectly possible. It is up to the country to hand over the pilot work to the new
private sector vendor or request to install a new instance.
Please note, underlying solutions picked in phase-1 Digital Auth, Digital Credentials,
Mapper can be reused across depts / vendors, the same way that in India, Digi
Locker credentials, Aadhaar, NPCI mapper is used by various DBT programs.

205
Country x DPG MOU /LoI FAQs
Please see the DaaS legal framework here 
Q. Whatʼs the overall legal framework of DaaS? 
A. There are 4 parties involved in DaaS: 
1.DaaS Country Partner - the Country department which is executing the DaaS
package 
2.DaaS DPG Partner - the DPG which is providing the DaaS product to be
deployed in the country
3.Service Provider(s) - the entity(ies) that will deploy, maintain and provide the
technical support during the pilot of DaaS 
4.Advisor - the partner covering all advisory ( managerial, technical, legal
etc)related to DaaS. For the first cohort, this will be the Centre for DPI.  
These parties interact with each other in the following ways: 
1.LoI or MOU between DaaS Country Partner and DaaS DPG Partner
2.Ecosystem Participation Terms signed by all SPs and DPGs part of the DaaS
ecosystem
3.MOU or LoI between the DaaS Country Partner and the Advisor (optional) 
Q. Why have we standardised a DaaS MoU at all for DPI Pilots across multiple
countries and across multiple DPGs? Canʼt we use an existing MoU template that
may be country-specific or DPG specific? 
A. The way DaaS pilots will scale in a safe and orderly manner across countries and
various building blocks is via standardisation of both technical products as well as
the legal and governance framework. The key advantages exist of leveraging a
standard MoU are: 

206
1.Accelerated Funding for Countries: The MoUs have been crafted in a manner
that builds comfort for funders and DPGs on various topics, such as data
governance; institutional ownership; timelines, etc. We can only guarantee
speed of funding approval with the standard DaaS MoU. 
2.Timely kick off of pilot: Existing MOUs or agreements may contain custom
formats or clauses that are different from the standard MOU language provided.
This customisation could delay the approval cycles for the DPG counterpart and
disrupt the fundamental target of DaaS which is rapid deployments of DPI pilots.
3.Multi-DPI Scale Up Potential for Countries: Once a DaaS MOU is signed,
annexes to same MOU can be reused by the country for additional DPI blocks
offered by the same DPG in the future. Once an MoU draft is approved, it
becomes a precedent for other departments in the country to use the same
draft to deploy DPI blocks offered by different DPGs in the future.
4.However this is only a recommended option. In case a country, due to its legal
and administrative contexts, require a different MOU, that can be considered by
adding a country specific annexe
Q. How is this MoU designed to scale up to multiple countries with different
contexts; different types of DPI products, etc?
A. Typically, the negotiation process for MOUs can act as roadblocks that delay
rapid deployment. This is why in DaaS, we have created a standard MOU template
that all parties can use to get swift approval from the legal teams and immediately
trigger approval and execution cycles. The MOUs are designed keeping the best
interests of the country at the forefront whilst allowing for an acceptable framework
for DPGs housed in various institutional contexts. It allows for a range of DPGs and
SPs to participate in the program, giving countries the optionality and agency to
choose their partners without being locked in to a particular vendor. Depending on
the specific DaaS product being deployed and the type of implementation (cloud-
based, on-prem etc), a standardised annex can be added into the MOUs to reflect
the details of the execution.  
Q. Does this MoU change if I choose an on-cloud vs an on-prem locally hosted DPI?

207
A. No, it doesnʼt. The choice of hosting the DPI (private cloud, public cloud, on-
prem) is a choice for countries when deploying DaaS. A standardised annex is
available for both options that can be incorporated into the MOU depending on the
countryʼs choice. 
Q. Does the MoU mention the specific Service Provider that will be deployed by the
DPG in the country, along with their roles and responsibilities? 
A: No, the MOU between the country and the DPG only lays a framework for DPGs
to engage a service provider(s) to provide technical capacity and support for
deployment in the local country context. The MoU is service provider agnostic.
Please note that the selection of the Service Provider may happen after this
Country-DPG MoU is signed and the SP may be adjusted/augmented if the
execution cycles of the SP do not meet the benchmarks set by the DPG. The roles
and responsibilities of the SPs are mentioned in the Ecosystem Participation Terms
signed by all SPs and DPGs.
Q. Will the Country-DPG MoU be available in a language other than English for
countries for whom English is not the native language? 
A: Since DaaS is a program offered globally, we have had to standardise the
language in order to help in scale. Due to this, the standard language for MOU is
English. However, the MOU can be translated into any language by the DaaS
implementer for their own records and reference. Since it is difficult for us to check
the accuracy of translated MOU, in case of a dispute, the English language MOU
will be considered as the legal basis for the DaaS engagement and be the version of
the MOU that is valid in the court of law. 
Q: Why have an MOU between a country and a DPG, when it is not the DPG who will
ultimately implement the product in the country, but rather the DPG will outsource it
to a third party (service provider)? 

208
A: The DPG is the ‘DaaS DPG Partnerʼ which means that it is the responsibility of the
DPG to support implementation of the DaaS package in the country. To do so, it
may utilise the support of a SP or multiple SPs to help with capacity building and
technical execution through a separate MOU. Since the DaaS product is owned by
the DPG, they will be responsible for training the SPs and ensuring that the
deployment adheres to best practices. 
There are multiple reasons for this: 
1. Countries are assured to get long term support on the open source software like
communications on sunset versions, backward compatibility upgrades on support
community versions, community connects, etc. that can help ensure that the
product is always adhering to the latest technology standards and industry best
practices. 
2. In the current DaaS design funders canʼt directly fund countries and the money
shall be routed through the DPGs to DPG trained and implementing svc partners. In
future, there can be other models to route funds and similar MoU templates will
emerge.
3. In this model, countries donʼt have to go through time consuming RFP routes to
pick implementation partners. They can quickly deploy DPI pilots to demonstrate
proof of concept and proof of success for the products in their own contexts. Post
the pilot, countries are expected to find long term svc partners as per countries
processes.
4. DaaS is about packaging policy, procurement, core product software, pre-built /
configured solutions, training etc. This MoU is a template to expedite roll out with
equal balance of speed and of ensuring that a country's independence and
sovereignty is protected.
5. In the current design, Svc Providers have a back to back agreement with DPGs to
ensure all obligations are delivered through them. This keeps all 3 parties (country
+ DPG + svc) aligned on the same track and moving efficiently. 
Q. How does this MoU ensure data protection and privacy, along with cybersecurity
in my DaaS DPI implementation?

209
The country owns the implementation. The data resides in servers , either on prem
or on cloud, which are directly and totally controlled by the government. The data is
encrypted at all levels. Neither the DPG nor the Service providers will have access
to data , unless the country allows for a specific purpose for a specific time and that
too under the watchful eyes of a country administrator
Q. How does this MoU protect against exogenous shocks, like a political or
economic crisis that may prevent the progress of the pilot? 
A. This MOU allows parties to pause or terminate the engagement in the event of
political unrest, a breakdown in public order, natural disasters, natural, health or
political emergencies, war or civil disorder or any governmental action that renders
the performance of the terms of this MoU impossible. This allows all parties to
safely pause or exit the engagement with least collateral damage, and perhaps, re
engage when the situation warrants. 
Q: What does CDPI/ EkStep get from this? 
A: Nothing, in monetary terms. CDPI is a philanthropically funded organisation, and
can thus, provide pro-bono support to countries to build their own DPI. DaaS is an
easier path for countries to securely, efficiently deploy DPI which aligns with our
mandate and mission of driving countriesʼ digitisation journeys. EkStep is a non-
profit organisation that builds DPGs that contribute to DPI, such as AI Assistant
which is a part of DaaS. They have a relationship with cloud providers and
hyperscalers, as well as experience in high-scale ecosystem technological
deployments to guide on design of standard artefacts, thus aligning with their
mandate. The only request we frame for countries to ‘give us in returnʼ is their
commitment to engage their best people and resources in order to help make this a
successful project for themselves, and associated third parties who are putting a lot
of effort into this.

Ecosystem Participation Terms FAQs
Please see the DaaS legal framework here 
Q. Whatʼs the overall legal framework of DaaS? 
A. There are 4 parties involved in DaaS: 
1.DaaS Country Partner - the Country department which is executing the DaaS
package 
2.DaaS DPG Partner - the DPG which is providing the DaaS product to be
deployed in the country
3.Service Provider(s) - the entity(ies) that will deploy, maintain and provide the
technical support during the pilot of DaaS 
4.Advisor - the partner covering all advisory ( managerial, technical, legal
etc)related to DaaS. For the first cohort, this will be the Centre for DPI.  
These parties interact with each other in the following ways: 
1.LoI or MOU between DaaS Country Partner and DaaS DPG Partner
2.Ecosystem Participation Terms signed by all SPs and DPGs part of the DaaS
ecosystem
3.MOU or LoI between the DaaS Country Partner and the Advisor (optional) 
Q. Why have ecosystem participation terms instead of bilateral contracts between
the DPG and SP?
A. Bilateral contracts usually undergo lengthy negotiation processes before each
signing and due to this, the terms agreed to by different DPGs and SPs would differ.
Due to this, the countries would have no common bar on how to assess the
offerings by the DPGs and the SP selection committee would have no common bar
on how to judge the SPs bidding for a project. The goal of the EPT is to align all
parties into basic foundational clauses such as cyber security, data portability, open
source code etc. to adhere to the 'rapid deployment' and 'standardisation' goals of
DaaS. 

211
Q. Will SPs still need an additional bilateral contract to close on compensation and
other details of implementation that cannot be standardised? 
A. The 'contract' in this case is a multi-party contract termed as Ecosystem
Participation Terms that lay out the general contracting clauses of any DaaS
implementation. The country-specific implementation details are governed by the
'Country Scope Document' which is signed off on by the Country and DPG, and
signed by the implementing SP - this also indicates the compensation amount,
deliverables, payment schedules etc. which would typically be covered under a
special contracting clause. 
Q. When do EPT terms kick in? 
A. The EPT comes into force only for the DPG and SP chosen for a particular
implementation post the signing of the country scope document. 
Q. Why does the MOU restrict Service Providers from using code under their own IP
that is not available through open source? 
A. The principle behind DaaS is standardisation and productization. This means that
all the products available through the DaaS program must be exactly replicable and
rapidly executable for multiple countries, hence it involves standard legal
frameworks, product kits, funding amounts etc. If a service provider brings in their
own proprietary code or IP into the execution cycle, multiple  scenarios separate
from the best practices of DaaS may play out: 
1.The country may get locked-in to that particular service provider since a new
vendor will not have access to that code or IP 
2.It will prevent the country or DPG from switching service providers mid-way in
case of any contingency 
3.The same DaaS product if deployed in another country with another service
provider will see a different execution with different features since the code will
not be replicable and it will defeat the purpose of DaaS 
Q. So can I as a Service Provider take the base-line open source product and pitch
it to countries myself without DaaS? 

212
A. Of course! In the initial cohorts of DaaS, the DPGs provide training and capacity
building for service providers on their products. Once a service provider feels
sufficiently empowered, they are free to approach countries directly and deploy the
open source code on their own, enhanced by their own IP as they see fit. 
Q. Why aren't cloud providers included in the EPT? 
A. Cloud providers typically have back-to-back contractual agreements with the SP
to support on country deployment. From a DaaS implementation perspective, we
did not want to distribute the accountability among various participating entities so
we restricted it to SPs who receive the compensation from the DPGs for
implementation and are thus, responsible for its timely execution. Cloud providers
would operate as an entity under the SPs.
However, similar to SPs, cloud providers are also empowered to individually utilise
DaaS artefacts and open source DPG code to implement independently in
countries.

C# **1\. Overview**

Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure (CDPI) curates open standards and specifications across various categories of DPIs for easy reference. This is an initiative to curate specifications that follow  
DPI principles  
to enable countries to create required Digital Public Infrastructure rails. This list includes open specifications that are published by non-profit global institutions or agreed upon based on a global governance, but also de-facto standards used by countries where the specifications have reached scale of over 10 Million+ transactions.  
Note:  
This is a draft and all stakeholders in DPI space can share their comments.  
Reference implementations listed here are as per the claim of implementing org. CDPI has not verified the claims.  
Countries are advised to independently verify at the time of the adoption.
