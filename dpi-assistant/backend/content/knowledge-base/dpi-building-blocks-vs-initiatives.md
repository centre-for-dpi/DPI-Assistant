# DPI Building Blocks vs. Initiatives/Specifications

## CRITICAL DISTINCTION

Many people confuse DPI initiatives/specifications with actual DPI building blocks. This document clarifies the difference.

## DPI Building Blocks (What Countries Actually Implement)

These are the actual infrastructure components that countries build:

1. **Digital Identity Systems** - The infrastructure for identifying and authenticating citizens
   - NOT specific products like Aadhaar, MOSIP, or eSignet
   - The building block is the identity infrastructure itself

2. **Payment Systems** - The infrastructure for digital transactions
   - **G2P Payments** - Government to Person payment infrastructure
   - **P2P Payments** - Person to Person payment infrastructure
   - **P2M Payments** - Person to Merchant payment infrastructure
   - NOT specific implementations like UPI or Pix

3. **Data Exchange/Registries** - Infrastructure for secure data sharing
   - NOT specific software like X-Road or OpenHIE
   - The building block is the data exchange capability

4. **Digital Credentials/Verifiable Credentials** - Infrastructure for issuing and verifying digital documents
   - NOT specific standards like W3C VC
   - The building block is the credentialing infrastructure

5. **Open Networks** - Infrastructure for decentralized commerce and services
   - NOT specific protocols like Beckn or ONDC
   - The building block is the open network infrastructure

## Initiatives/Specifications/Standards (Reference Materials)

These provide guidance, standards, and specifications but are NOT building blocks themselves:

### G2P Connect
- **What it is**: A community initiative providing specifications for G2P payments
- **What it's NOT**: A DPI building block
- **Correct usage**: "Build G2P payment infrastructure using G2P Connect specifications"
- **INCORRECT**: "Implement G2P Connect" or "Deploy G2P Connect"

### MOSIP
- **What it is**: An open-source identity platform
- **What it's NOT**: The DPI building block itself
- **Correct usage**: "Implement a digital identity system using MOSIP"
- **INCORRECT**: "MOSIP is a DPI building block"

### Beckn Protocol
- **What it is**: Specifications for open networks
- **What it's NOT**: The DPI building block itself
- **Correct usage**: "Build open network infrastructure using Beckn protocol"
- **INCORRECT**: "Implement Beckn as a DPI building block"

### X-Road
- **What it is**: Software for implementing data exchange
- **What it's NOT**: The DPI building block itself
- **Correct usage**: "Implement data exchange infrastructure using X-Road"
- **INCORRECT**: "X-Road is a DPI building block"

### UPI/Pix
- **What they are**: Specific implementations of payment infrastructure
- **What they're NOT**: The DPI building blocks themselves
- **Correct usage**: "Build payment infrastructure inspired by UPI/Pix"
- **INCORRECT**: "UPI is a DPI building block"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Countries implement BUILDING BLOCKS, not specifications**
2. **Specifications and initiatives provide GUIDANCE**
3. **The building block is the CAPABILITY, not the specific technology**
4. **When recommending DPI, suggest the infrastructure type, not the brand/initiative**

## Examples of Correct Language

✅ **CORRECT**: 
- "Implement G2P payment infrastructure"
- "Build a digital identity system"
- "Create data exchange capabilities"
- "Use G2P Connect specifications as a reference"
- "Consider MOSIP for your identity infrastructure"

❌ **INCORRECT**:
- "Implement G2P Connect"
- "Deploy MOSIP as your DPI building block"
- "Install Beckn protocol"
- "G2P Connect is a quick win DPI"

Remember: The goal is to build CAPABILITIES, not to deploy specific products or initiatives.
