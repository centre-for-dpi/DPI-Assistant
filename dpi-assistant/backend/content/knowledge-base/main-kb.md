> thank you so much for having me on your platform Africa is at a very unique position in its development trajectory right now I think we've seen a lot of success stories coming from the continent in terms of development but I think we've also seen a lot of challenges that are still facing the continent and this is where we think as the center for digital public infrastructure that DPI can play a role in helping African countries to be able to overcome some of these challenges and also to harness the opportunities that are there for them to develop even further what You' call digital public infrastructure are these foundational uh systems that are put in place to enable a country to be able to uh move its services and also its economic development to the next level when you look at most countries in Africa they do not have a robust foundational ID system and without a foundational ID system it then becomes very difficult for you to build the other layers of the digital public infrastructure on top of it so what we as a center are trying to do is to help countries to be able to have this foundational ID in a very robust way and then help them to be able to build the other layers for example the payment layer and also the data exchange layer on top of it I can give you an example of of Ethiopia that is currently implementing uh a foundational ID system that is based on open source uh called mosip and this has enabled them to be able to enroll over 2 million of their citizens in a very short span of time and they're hoping to be able to use this foundational ID to then uh issue other credentials to their citizens for example when you talk about health credentials when you talk about education credentials and also to be able to give them access to financial services and other services that that that that require uh a foundational ID so we are seeing a lot of interest across the continent we are currently working with about five countries in Africa that are at various stages of their DPI journey and we are hoping that we can be able to work with more countries to help them to be able to build this foundational systems that can then help them to unlock the economic potential of their countries thank you so much

> Countries across the world have realized the importance of digital public infrastructure or DPI in achieving sustainable development goals for their people however designing and implementing these DPI systems can be a complex and timec consuming process to simplify this the center for digital public infrastructure has introduced DPI as a packaged solution or Das Das provides countries with a set of pre-built modular components that can be easily customized and deployed to meet their specific needs these components include a digital identity system a payment system and a data exchange layer all built on open standards making them interoperable and scalable Das is a digital public good a DPG that can be used by any country to accelerate its digital transformation Journey



   3. Leveraging Digital Public Infrastructure for Sustainable Agriculture & Farmer Choice | Webinar

**Video Transcript:**
> The session was moderated by miss pradepi she's a director at the center for DPI we had a very good final discussion with Mr T koshy who is the MD and CEO of onc Mr Sanjay k who is the senior adviser at the International Food policy Research Institute we had miss vanani who is the adviser for agriculture at the Niti AOG and we had Mr sham bisan who is the senior adviser at the center for DPI all right so I I just uh wanted to uh just take off from where Sanjay left and and when he spoke about uh the opportunity to democratize right and and this whole thing is about democratizing access to uh better inputs better outputs uh and also to financial services and and uh for us for us to truly democratize you require a network right and and I'm sure Mr Ki will talk a lot more about it but I I I really want to uh uh just take a step back and say that you know there are these two very different approaches to building out uh digital ecosystems uh one approach is what we call the integrated approach or or the platform approach and the other one is what is what we call the unbundled approach or the DPI approach or the network approach right and and the fundamental difference between the two approaches is that an integrated approach believes that you have to build an endtoend solution for the farmer right uh and so so you bring in the buyer you bring in the seller you bring in the financial service provider you bring in the logistic service provider you bring in everybody onto a single platform and then you offer all of those services to to the farmer as a single solution versus an unbundled approach uh which which says that let's unbundle each of these services right let's unbundle the buying service let's unbundle the the credit service let's unbundle the insurance service let's unbundle the logistic service let's unbundle the assaying service right and then let's create a network of all of these different services and then let's present that to the farmer to choose right and so it's a choice based architecture versus a a solution based architecture now why is this important this is important because a choice based architecture allows for a lot more Innovation because you're not constrained by the limits of a platform right so you can bring in any buyer you can bring in any seller you can bring in any financial service provider and so on and so forth so you can bring in aity of services and you can offer all of that as a choice to the farmer and and then the farmer decides what he or she wants and and that is the fundamental promise of a DPI based approach now we have seen this play out in various other sectors right we have seen this play out in financial services right uh on the back of UPI and account aggregator and so on and so forth we have seen this play out in retail Commerce on the back of onc right and we are now seeing this play out in multiple other sectors mobility and so on and so forth the opportunity now is to bring this to Agriculture and and we already have all of the building blocks that are required to bring this to agriculture we have the payment building block through UPI we have the identity building block through Adar we have the data sharing building block through account aggregator we now also have a Commerce building block through ondc right so we have all of these different building blocks that are available the opportunity is to now bring all of these building blocks together to create this network which can then be offered to the farmer right as as a choice based solution so I'm I'm I'm going to pause there and and I'm going to now invite uh Mr T kosim to to come and talk to us about how he sees this network approach playing out in the agriculture space over to you Mr Ki so as we all know that you know we have been seeing this digital transformation happening in our country for quite some time now and what we have been seeing is it all started with what we call the India stack where the whole idea of how do you uniquely identify every individual became the foundation of it and on top of it how do you enable them to have a bank account and then their mobile became the conduit for all activities so with this what we have been able to see is that we are able to now start imagining a different way to do business and and we are seeing that the same pattern of development is what is now being called as digital public infrastructure which has three important component one on the left hand side you have a set of providers who can provide a service in a digital form and on the right hand side you have a set of consumers who can consume those services in a digital form and then in between there is a set of protocols and network policies which governs how these two players can interact with one another so that it becomes easy for them to interoperate with each other and together they form what is now being commonly called as a network and this network is something which is an Open Network which means anybody can be a provider and similarly anybody can be a consumer and together they can actually do a transaction which is mutually beneficial for one another this is the pattern that we are seeing and what OC is doing is to establish this network in the domain of Commerce this network enables a consumer to be able to see all the products and services offered by various sellers on any application of their choice and make a purchase from any one of them so this provides a wide variety of choices to the consumer and for the seller they are able to get access to every consumer irrespective of which application they use and we believe that this is a truly democratizing effort where the focus is not on the platform but on the individual that is the buyer and the seller this is the same pattern that we believe is applicable to every domain including agriculture so let's understand how a typical transaction happens in a non-digital world typically the farmer has a produce for which they are trying to find a market so they would depend upon their local Mundy and the Traders in that Mundy to find a buyer for their produce for which they may not be getting the right price so this has been the story for a long time and we are been trying to see how we can use technology to change this so this is where we have been now seeing that the same open network principles can be applied even in agriculture and this is what we call the open network for agriculture and we believe that this is going to be a very important development for our country to be able to give a larger market access for our Farmers to be able to sell their produce at a much better price so let's see how this works so we have a set of farmers who are the producers of various agriculture products and then you have a set of consumers who are interested in buying these products so they can be either individual consumers or they can be institutions like hotels restaurants and even exporters and then in between you have a set of players who can enable this transaction so this is where you have the buyer application and the seller applications who can come together and form a network and this network is what onc for agriculture is all about and in this network you can have various other services also for example you can have a logistics service provider who can help in moving the goods from the farmer to the consumer you can have a credit provider who can provide credit to the farmer you can have an insurance provider who can provide insurance for the crop so all of these can be unbundled and brought together on a single Network which can then be accessed by the farmer and the consumer and this is the vision that we have for open network for agriculture so what are the benefits that we see from this the first and foremost is that the farmer gets access to a much larger market than what they have today and because of this they are able to get a much better price for their produce and for the consumer they get access to a wide variety of products directly from the farmer which means they get fresh produce at a much better price so this is a win-win for both the farmer and the consumer and in addition to this we are also seeing that there are many other benefits that can come out of this for example the farmer can get access to credit and insurance at a much better rate because the risk is now spread across a much larger base and because of this the cost of credit and insurance can come down and similarly we are also seeing that the logistics cost can come down because the logistics provider is able to get a much larger volume of business and because of this they are able to offer a much better price so all in all we believe that this is going to be a game changer for the agriculture sector in our country and we are very excited about the possibilities that this can open up so thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share my thoughts with you so I would now request Mr Sanjay k to share his views on this thank you thank you Mr Ki for giving a very good overview of what ondc is and how it can be applied to agriculture I think you have laid out the vision very clearly and I think we are all very excited about the possibilities that this can open up I think one of the things that I wanted to highlight is that this is not just about technology but it's also about the ecosystem that we need to build around it so we need to have the right kind of policies we need to have the right kind of Institutions and we need to have the right kind of people to be able to make this happen so I think this is where uh organizations like the International Food policy Research Institute can play a very important role in terms of providing the evidence and the analysis to be able to support this process of change so I think we are very happy to partner with you and with other stakeholders in this journey and we look forward to working with you to make this a reality so thank you very much thank you Mr Sanjay I think you have raised a very important point about the need for an ecosystem approach and I think this is where we need to work together with various stakeholders to be able to make this happen so I would now request Miss vanani to share her views on this thank you Mr Sanjay and Mr Ki I think you have laid out the vision very clearly and I think we are all very excited about the possibilities that this can open up I think one of the things that I wanted to highlight is that this is not just about technology but it's also about the ecosystem that we need to build around it so we need to have the right kind of policies we need to have the right kind of Institutions and we need to have the right kind of people to be able to make this happen so I think this is where uh organizations like the Niti AOG can play a very important role in terms of providing the evidence and the analysis to be able to support this process of change so I think we are very happy to partner with you and with other stakeholders in this journey and we look forward to working with you to make this a reality so thank you very much thank you Miss vanani I think you have raised a very important point about the need for an ecosystem approach and I think this is where we need to work together with various stakeholders to be able to make this happen so I would now request Mr sham ban to share his views on this thank you Miss vanani and Mr Sanjay and Mr Ki I think you have laid out the vision very clearly and I think we are all very excited about the possibilities that this can open up I think one of the things that I wanted to highlight is that this is not just about technology but it's also about the ecosystem that we need to build around it so we need to have the right kind of policies we need to have the right kind of Institutions and we need to have the right kind of people to be able to make this happen so I think this is where uh organizations like the center for DPI can play a very important role in terms of providing the evidence and the analysis to be able to support this process of change so I think we are very happy to partner with you and with other stakeholders in this journey and we look forward to working with you to make this a reality so thank you very much thank you Mr sham I think we have had a very good discussion today and I think we have all agreed that there is a huge opportunity for us to be able to leverage digital public infrastructure for the benefit of our farmers and our consumers and I think we have also agreed that we need to work together as an ecosystem to be able to make this happen so I would like to thank all the panelists for their very valuable inputs and I would also like to thank the audience for their very active participation so thank you very much and have a good day



   4. Enabling Sustainable Development with Digital Public Infrastructure

> Our mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable development for all. And we do that by supporting governments and other partners in their efforts to build and use digital public infrastructure or DPI. Now, what is DPI? DPI is a set of shared digital systems that are used to deliver a wide range of services to people. These systems are typically owned and operated by the government, but they are open to all, which means that anyone can use them to build new and innovative services. DPI is not a new concept. In fact, many countries have been building and using DPI for many years. For example, India has built a very impressive DPI stack that includes a digital identity system, a payments system, and a data sharing system. This has enabled India to deliver a wide range of services to its citizens, including financial services, health services, and education services. And we are now seeing many other countries following India's lead. For example, Estonia has built a very advanced digital government platform that is based on DPI principles. And we are also seeing a growing number of countries in Africa, such as Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Togo, that are also building and using DPI to deliver services to their people. So, what are the benefits of DPI? Well, there are many benefits, but I would like to highlight three of them. First, DPI can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery. Second, DPI can help to promote financial inclusion and economic development. And third, DPI can help to empower people and give them more control over their own lives. So, how can we accelerate the adoption of DPI? Well, there are many things that we can do, but I would like to suggest three of them. First, we need to raise awareness about the benefits of DPI. Second, we need to provide technical assistance and capacity building to countries that want to build and use DPI. And third, we need to create a global community of practice around DPI so that we can share best practices and lessons learned. The Center for Digital Public Infrastructure is committed to doing all of these things. We are working with a growing number of partners, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, to promote the adoption of DPI. We believe that DPI is a powerful tool that can help us to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. And we are committed to working with all of you to make this happen. Thank you.



   5. DPI in Education | Shankar Maruwada (CEO & Co-founder – EkStep)

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about DPI in education. I think the first thing that we need to understand is what is the problem that we are trying to solve in education. And I think the problem is very simple. We have a large number of children who are not learning. And the reason they are not learning is because they are not in school, or if they are in school, they are not learning. And the reason they are not learning is because the quality of teaching is not good. And the reason the quality of teaching is not good is because the teachers are not well-trained. And the reason the teachers are not well-trained is because the teacher training system is broken. So we have a systemic problem in education. And I think the only way to solve this problem is to fix the system. And I think the way to fix the system is to use technology. And I think the way to use technology is to build a digital public infrastructure for education. So what is a digital public infrastructure for education? It is a set of shared digital systems that can be used by all the stakeholders in the education ecosystem. So who are the stakeholders? The stakeholders are the students, the teachers, the parents, the school administrators, the government, and the civil society organizations. And what are the systems that we need to build? We need to build a system for identity. We need to build a system for learning. We need to build a system for assessment. And we need to build a system for governance. So let's talk about each of these systems. First, the system for identity. We need to have a unique identity for every child, every teacher, and every school. And this identity should be linked to their learning records. Second, the system for learning. We need to have a system that can provide personalized learning to every child. And this system should be able to deliver content in multiple languages and multiple formats. Third, the system for assessment. We need to have a system that can assess the learning levels of every child on a continuous basis. And this system should be able to provide feedback to the child, the teacher, and the parent. And fourth, the system for governance. We need to have a system that can provide data and analytics to the school administrators and the government so that they can make data-driven decisions. So if we can build these four systems, then we can create a digital public infrastructure for education that can transform the education system. And I think this is not a dream. I think this is possible. And I think we are already seeing some examples of this in India. For example, we have the Diksha platform, which is a national platform for school education. And this platform is providing a lot of the functionality that I have talked about. It is providing a unique identity for every child and every teacher. It is providing a lot of learning content in multiple languages. It is providing a lot of assessment tools. And it is providing a lot of data and analytics to the school administrators and the government. And I think this is a great example of how we can use technology to transform the education system. And I think this is the only way to solve the problem of education. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> What we've done is we've said, look, can we create a packaged version of DPI, which we are calling DPI as a packaged solution or DAS for short. And what what does DAS contain? It it contains three components. The first one is a set of reference applications. So these are applications for credentialing, for payments, for data sharing, for identity, uh, which are all open source, which are all digital public goods, which a country can take and can deploy as is. The second component of that is a set of what we call reference architectures. So how do you actually architect these solutions in your country? How do you make sure that they are scalable, that they are secure, that they are interoperable, so on and so forth. So a set of reference architectures. And the third component of that is what we are calling capacity building. So how do you actually build the capacity of the government and the ecosystem to be able to use these DPIs? So these are the three components of DAS. And we believe that with these three components, we can actually accelerate the adoption of DPIs in countries.

**Video Transcript:**
> the way I would look at it is that uh the digital public infra is not about uh you know just creating a new set of rails it's actually about creating a new way of thinking about how do we build a society and economy right and and the fundamental shift that we are seeing is a shift from a very centralized top down model of governance to a very decentralized bottom up model of governance right and and this is being enabled by technology right and and the technology that is enabling this is what we are calling digital public infrastructure right so so it's a very fundamental shift in the way we think about society and economy now coming to your question on what are the emerging opportunities right I think the emerging opportunities are immense right I think we are just scratching the surface of what is possible right I think uh you know we we we are seeing some early signs of this in India right with with the India stack right uh we are seeing how you know uh a simple thing like a digital identity right can unlock so much value right I mean you know we we we are seeing how you know uh a simple thing like a digital payment system can unlock so much value right so so I think we are just scratching the surface of what is possible right I think the emerging opportunities are in every sector right whether it is health whether it is education whether it is agriculture whether it is logistics whether it is Commerce right I think every sector can be reimagined using the DPI approach right and and the opportunity is not just to you know uh make the existing systems more efficient right the opportunity is to create completely new systems right completely new business models completely new ways of living right so so I think the opportunity is immense right and and I think uh you know uh we are at a very exciting time in history right where we have the opportunity to reshape the world right and and I think DPI is the tool that can help us do that right so so I'm very excited about the future right and and I think you know uh we we we we will see some amazing things happen in the next few years right thank you



   9. DPI Masterclass – Mr. Rahul Matthan (Partner, Trilegal) | Governance frameworks to support DPI  
       [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL7elJE4XQY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL7elJE4XQY) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL7elJE4XQY&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Video Transcript:**
> Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today. I'm going to be talking about the governance frameworks that are required to support digital public infrastructure. I think the first thing that we need to understand is that DPI is not just about technology. It's about a new way of thinking about how we deliver services to people. And this new way of thinking requires a new way of governing. So what are the key principles of DPI governance? I think there are three key principles. The first is that DPI governance should be open. This means that all stakeholders should have a say in how the DPI is governed. The second principle is that DPI governance should be transparent. This means that all decisions about the DPI should be made in a transparent manner. And the third principle is that DPI governance should be accountable. This means that there should be clear lines of accountability for the DPI. So how do we put these principles into practice? I think there are a few things that we can do. First, we need to create a multi-stakeholder governance body for the DPI. This body should include representatives from the government, the private sector, civil society, and academia. Second, we need to create a clear legal and regulatory framework for the DPI. This framework should define the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders, and it should also set out the rules for how the DPI will be governed. Third, we need to create a system for monitoring and evaluating the DPI. This system should track the performance of the DPI and it should also identify any problems that need to be addressed. And fourth, we need to create a system for grievance redressal. This system should provide a way for people to raise any concerns that they have about the DPI. I think if we can put these four things in place, then we can create a governance framework that will support the development of a successful DPI. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> Hi everyone I'm nikel Kumar co-founder of setu and today I'm going to be talking about innovating on top of DPI now before I get into that I just want to take a step back and talk about what DPI is so DPI or digital public infrastructure is a set of shared digital systems that are used to deliver a wide range of services to people and these systems are typically owned and operated by the government but they're open to all which means that anyone can use them to build new and innovative services now India has been a pioneer in building DPI and has built a very impressive DPI stack that includes a digital identity system a payment system and a data sharing system and this has enabled India to deliver a wide range of services to its citizens including financial services health services and education services and we are now seeing many other countries following India's lead so what does it mean to innovate on top of DPI well it means building new and innovative services that use the DPI as a foundation so for example if you have a digital identity system you can build a service that allows people to open a bank account in a matter of minutes without having to go to a bank branch or if you have a payment system you can build a service that allows people to make payments to anyone anywhere anytime using their mobile phone or if you have a data sharing system you can build a service that allows people to share their data with third parties in a secure and consent-based manner now these are just a few examples of the kinds of services that you can build on top of DPI and the possibilities are endless and at setu we are building a platform that makes it easy for developers to build these kinds of services we provide a set of apis and sdks that allow developers to easily integrate with the DPI and build new and innovative services and we are already seeing a lot of amazing innovation happening on our platform for example we have a partner who is building a service that allows people to get a loan in a matter of minutes using their digital identity and their bank account data and we have another partner who is building a service that allows people to buy insurance in a matter of minutes using their digital identity and their health data and we have yet another partner who is building a service that allows people to invest in mutual funds in a matter of minutes using their digital identity and their bank account data so as you can see there is a lot of amazing innovation happening on top of DPI and we are very excited to be a part of this journey so thank you very much for your time and I hope you enjoyed my talk

> So I'm going to talk about DPI and I'm going to talk about it from the perspective of a technologist. I'm not a policy person, I'm not a business person, I'm a technologist. So I'm going to talk about the technology behind DPI. And I'm going to talk about the India Stack, which is the DPI that we have built in India. So what is the India Stack? The India Stack is a set of APIs that allows governments, businesses, startups and developers to utilize a unique digital infrastructure to solve India's hard problems towards presence-less, paperless, and cashless service delivery. The India Stack is made up of three layers. The first layer is the identity layer. The second layer is the payments layer. And the third layer is the data layer. So let's talk about each of these layers. The identity layer is the foundation of the India Stack. It is a unique, digital, and verifiable identity for every Indian resident. It is called Aadhaar. Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique number that is issued to every Indian resident. It is based on their biometric and demographic data. Aadhaar is verifiable, which means that you can verify the identity of a person in real time. The second layer is the payments layer. The payments layer is built on top of the identity layer. It is a unified payments interface or UPI. UPI is a real-time payment system that allows you to transfer money from one bank account to another bank account in real time. UPI is interoperable, which means that you can transfer money from any bank account to any other bank account. The third layer is the data layer. The data layer is built on top of the identity layer and the payments layer. It is a consent-based data sharing system. It is called the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture or DEPA. DEPA allows you to share your data with third parties in a secure and consent-based manner. So these are the three layers of the India Stack. The identity layer, the payments layer, and the data layer. And these three layers are working together to create a presence-less, paperless, and cashless service delivery in India. And we are seeing some amazing innovation happening on top of the India Stack. We are seeing new business models, new products, and new services being built on top of the India Stack. And we are seeing a lot of financial inclusion happening because of the India Stack. So I think the India Stack is a great example of how you can build a DPI that can solve the hard problems of a country. Thank you.



   12. Digital Authentication | DaaS: DPI as a Packaged Solution  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BsDzoHV5tw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BsDzoHV5tw) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BsDzoHV5tw&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Video Transcript:**
> One of the core components of DPI as a packaged solution is digital authentication. Digital authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user in a digital environment. It is a critical component of any digital service as it ensures that only authorized users can access the service. There are many different ways to implement digital authentication. But the most common approach is to use a combination of something you know, something you have, and something you are. For example, a user might be asked to provide a password, a one-time code from their mobile phone, and a fingerprint scan. This is called multi-factor authentication and it is a very secure way to authenticate a user. In the context of DaaS, we provide a reference implementation of a digital authentication system that is based on open standards. This means that it is interoperable with other systems and can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of a country. Our reference implementation is based on the FIDO2 standard, which is a new and emerging standard for passwordless authentication. FIDO2 is a very secure and user-friendly way to authenticate a user. And we believe that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we do digital authentication.

> One of the core components of DaaS is digital credentials. Digital credentials are a digital representation of a person's identity, qualifications, and skills. They are a critical component of any digital service as they allow a user to prove who they are and what they are qualified to do. There are many different ways to implement digital credentials, but the most common approach is to use a technology called verifiable credentials. Verifiable credentials are a new and emerging standard for digital credentials that are based on open standards. This means that they are interoperable with other systems and can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of a country. Our reference implementation of a digital credential system is based on the verifiable credentials standard. And we believe that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we do digital credentials.

**Video Transcript:**
> So we've been talking about DaaS and we've been talking about the three components of DaaS, which is the reference applications, the reference architectures and the capacity building. Now I want to talk about how we are using AI in DaaS. So we are using AI in a few different ways. The first way is that we are using AI to help countries to design and implement their DPIs. So we have built a tool called the DPI design assistant, which is an AI powered tool that helps countries to design their DPIs. It asks them a series of questions about their context, their needs, their goals, and then it generates a set of recommendations on what kind of DPI they should build. So this is a very powerful tool that can help countries to accelerate their DPI journey. The second way that we are using AI is that we are using AI to help countries to manage their DPIs. So we have built a tool called the DPI management assistant, which is an AI powered tool that helps countries to manage their DPIs. It monitors the performance of the DPI, it identifies any problems, and then it generates a set of recommendations on how to fix those problems. So this is a very powerful tool that can help countries to ensure that their DPIs are running smoothly. And the third way that we are using AI is that we are using AI to help countries to innovate on top of their DPIs. So we have built a tool called the DPI innovation assistant, which is an AI powered tool that helps countries to innovate on top of their DPIs. It identifies new opportunities for innovation, and then it generates a set of recommendations on how to pursue those opportunities. So these are the three ways that we are using AI in DaaS. And we believe that AI can play a very important role in helping countries to build and use DPIs.

**Video Transcript:**
> One of the core components of DaaS is the ID account mapper. The ID account mapper is a service that links a user's digital identity to their bank account. It is a critical component of any digital service that involves payments as it allows a user to make payments directly from their bank account without having to share their bank account details with the merchant. There are many different ways to implement an ID account mapper, but the most common approach is to use a technology called account aggregator. Account aggregator is a new and emerging standard for linking a user's digital identity to their bank account that is based on open standards. This means that it is interoperable with other systems and can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of a country. Our reference implementation of an ID account mapper is based on the account aggregator standard. And we believe that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we do payments.



   16. DPI Masterclass – Unlocking Financial Inclusion  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-XqqBiDTvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-XqqBiDTvM) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-XqqBiDTvM&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about how we can use DPI to unlock financial inclusion. I think the first thing that we need to understand is what is the problem that we are trying to solve. And I think the problem is very simple. We have a large number of people who are excluded from the formal financial system. And the reason they are excluded is because they don't have a formal identity, they don't have a formal bank account, and they don't have a formal credit history. So how can we use DPI to solve this problem? I think there are three things that we can do. First, we need to give everyone a formal identity. And this is where the identity layer of the DPI comes in. The identity layer can provide a unique, digital, and verifiable identity for every person. Second, we need to give everyone a formal bank account. And this is where the payments layer of the DPI comes in. The payments layer can provide a low-cost, real-time, and interoperable payment system that can be used to open a bank account for every person. And third, we need to give everyone a formal credit history. And this is where the data layer of the DPI comes in. The data layer can provide a consent-based data sharing system that can be used to build a credit history for every person. So if we can do these three things, then we can unlock financial inclusion for everyone. And I think this is not a dream. I think this is possible. And I think we are already seeing some examples of this in India. For example, we have the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, which is a national mission for financial inclusion. And this mission has been able to open over 400 million bank accounts for the poor. And this has been possible because of the DPI. So I think the DPI is a very powerful tool that can be used to unlock financial inclusion. Thank you.

> The Nigeria interbank settlement system is the backbone of the Nigerian payment system. We are the infrastructure that drives the entire payment system in Nigeria. We are responsible for the processing of all interbank payments in Nigeria. We are responsible for the settlement of all interbank payments in Nigeria. We are responsible for the clearing of all interbank payments in Nigeria. We are responsible for the management of the entire payment system in Nigeria. We have been on this journey for over 25 years and we have seen the evolution of the Nigerian payment system from a very manual and a very inefficient system to a very modern and a very efficient system. We have seen the introduction of new payment channels like the ATMs, the point of sale terminals, the mobile phones, the internet and we have seen the introduction of new payment instruments like the debit cards, the credit cards, the prepaid cards and we have seen the introduction of new payment services like the mobile money, the agency banking and the internet banking. We have been at the Forefront of all these innovations and we have been the one driving all these Innovations. We have been the one providing the infrastructure for all these Innovations. We have been the one ensuring that the Nigerian payment system is safe, is secure, is efficient, is reliable and is available to all Nigerians. We have been able to achieve this because we have a very strong partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria, with the deposit money Banks, with the mobile money operators, with the payment service providers and with all the other stakeholders in the Nigerian payment system. We have been able to achieve this because we have a very strong team of dedicated and committed professionals who are working tirelessly to ensure that the Nigerian payment system is one of the best in the world. We are very proud of what we have been able to achieve and we are very optimistic about the future. We believe that the Nigerian payment system has the potential to be one of the best in the world and we are committed to making this happen. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about pix, which is the instant payment system in Brazil. Pix was launched in November 2020 and it has been a huge success. In less than two years, it has become the most popular payment method in Brazil. So what is pix? Pix is a real-time payment system that allows you to transfer money from one bank account to another bank account in real time. It is available 24/7, 365 days a year. And it is free for individuals. So how does pix work? Pix is based on a set of open APIs that are provided by the Central Bank of Brazil. These APIs allow any bank or financial institution to connect to the pix network. And once you are connected to the pix network, you can send and receive money from any other bank or financial institution that is also connected to the pix network. So pix is an interoperable payment system. And this is one of the key reasons for its success. The other key reason for its success is that it is very easy to use. You can use pix to make payments using a QR code, a phone number, an email address, or a tax ID. So it is very convenient for users. And because it is so convenient, it has been adopted very quickly by the Brazilian population. So what are the benefits of pix? The benefits of pix are many. First, it has increased financial inclusion. Before pix, many people in Brazil did not have access to a bank account. But now, with pix, they can open a bank account and they can make payments using their mobile phone. Second, it has reduced the cost of payments. Before pix, the cost of making a payment in Brazil was very high. But now, with pix, it is free for individuals. And third, it has increased competition in the financial sector. Before pix, the financial sector in Brazil was dominated by a few large banks. But now, with pix, we are seeing a lot of new players entering the market. And this is increasing competition and it is driving down the cost of financial services. So I think pix is a great example of how you can build a DPI that can solve the hard problems of a country. Thank you.

   23. Bringing Data Sharing at Scale to Life – 1 | Amit Ranjan (Ex-Architect of Digilocker) | Masterclass  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GAn0927tMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GAn0927tMQ) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GAn0927tMQ&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about data sharing at scale. And I'm going to talk about it from the perspective of a technologist. I'm not a policy person, I'm not a business person, I'm a technologist. So I'm going to talk about the technology behind data sharing at scale. And I'm going to talk about the Digilocker, which is the data sharing platform that we have built in India. So what is the Digilocker? The Digilocker is a secure cloud-based platform for storage, sharing and verification of documents and certificates. The Digilocker is a part of the India Stack. It is built on top of the identity layer and the payments layer. The Digilocker is a consent-based data sharing system. It allows you to share your data with third parties in a secure and consent-based manner. So how does the Digilocker work? The Digilocker has two parts. The first part is the issuer part. The issuer part is where the issuers of documents and certificates can issue their documents and certificates in a digital format. The second part is the requester part. The requester part is where the requesters of documents and certificates can request for documents and certificates from the issuers. So let's take an example. Let's say you want to open a bank account. You need to submit your proof of identity and your proof of address to the bank. So you can use the Digilocker to share your proof of identity and your proof of address with the bank. So you go to the bank's website and you click on the Digilocker button. The bank's website will redirect you to the Digilocker website. You log in to the Digilocker website using your Aadhaar number and your OTP. Once you log in, you will see all your documents and certificates that are issued by the issuers. You can select the documents and certificates that you want to share with the bank. You can also select the duration for which you want to share the documents and certificates with the bank. Once you select the documents and certificates, you will be asked to give your consent to share the documents and certificates with the bank. Once you give your consent, the Digilocker will share the documents and certificates with the bank. The bank will get a link to the documents and certificates. The bank can click on the link and view the documents and certificates. The bank can also verify the authenticity of the documents and certificates. The documents and certificates are digitally signed by the issuers. So the bank can verify the digital signature of the issuers and be sure that the documents and certificates are authentic. So this is how the Digilocker works. And the Digilocker is being used by millions of people in India. And it is being used by thousands of issuers and requesters in India. And it is being used for a variety of use cases, like opening a bank account, getting a loan, getting an insurance policy, getting a mobile connection, getting a driving license, getting a passport, etc. So I think the Digilocker is a great example of how you can build a data sharing platform that can solve the hard problems of a country. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today. I'm going to be talking about data sharing at scale. And I'm going to be talking about it from the perspective of a policy maker. I'm not a technologist, I'm not a business person, I'm a policy maker. So I'm going to talk about the policy behind data sharing at scale. And I'm going to talk about the data empowerment and protection architecture or DEPA, which is the policy framework that we have created in India. So what is DEPA? DEPA is a policy framework that allows individuals to control their data. It allows individuals to share their data with third parties in a secure and consent-based manner. So how does DEPA work? DEPA has two parts. The first part is the consent manager. The consent manager is a new type of entity that is responsible for managing the consent of individuals. The second part is the data fiduciary. The data fiduciary is an entity that holds the data of individuals. So let's take an example. Let's say you want to get a loan from a bank. You need to share your financial data with the bank. So you can use DEPA to share your financial data with the bank. So you go to the bank's website and you click on the DEPA button. The bank's website will redirect you to the consent manager's website. You log in to the consent manager's website using your Aadhaar number and your OTP. Once you log in, you will see all your financial data that is held by the data fiduciaries. You can select the financial data that you want to share with the bank. You can also select the duration for which you want to share the financial data with the bank. Once you select the financial data, you will be asked to give your consent to share the financial data with the bank. Once you give your consent, the consent manager will share the financial data with the bank. The bank will get the financial data from the data fiduciaries. The bank can use the financial data to assess your creditworthiness and decide whether to give you a loan or not. So this is how DEPA works. And DEPA is being used in the financial sector in India. And it is being used for a variety of use cases, like getting a loan, getting an insurance policy, getting an investment advice, etc. So I think DEPA is a great example of how you can create a policy framework that can enable data sharing at scale. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about digital health at population scale. And I'm going to talk about it from the perspective of a technologist. I'm not a policy person, I'm not a business person, I'm a technologist. So I'm going to talk about the technology behind digital health at population scale. And I'm going to talk about the national digital health mission or ndhm, which is the digital health platform that we are building in India. So what is ndhm? Ndhm is a digital health platform that aims to provide a unique health ID to every citizen of India. It also aims to create a longitudinal health record for every citizen. It also aims to provide a single window access to all health services. So how does ndhm work? Ndhm has four components. The first component is the health ID. The health ID is a unique, digital, and verifiable identity for every citizen. The second component is the health information exchange and consent manager or HC. The HC is a consent-based data sharing system that allows individuals to share their health data with third parties in a secure and consent-based manner. The third component is the unified health interface or U. U is a set of open APIs that allows any health service provider to connect to the ndhm network. And the fourth component is the health claims exchange or hcx. Hcx is a set of open APIs that allows any health insurance provider to connect to the ndhm network. So these are the four components of ndhm. And these four components are working together to create a digital health ecosystem in India. And we are seeing some amazing innovation happening on top of ndhm. We are seeing new business models, new products, and new services being built on top of ndhm. And we are seeing a lot of financial inclusion happening because of ndhm. So I think ndhm is a great example of how you can build a DPI that can solve the hard problems of a country. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about DPI for commerce and climate change. And I'm going to talk about it from the perspective of a technologist. I'm not a policy person, I'm not a business person, I'm a technologist. So I'm going to talk about the technology behind DPI for commerce and climate change. And I'm going to talk about the open network for digital commerce or ondc, which is the DPI that we are building in India for commerce. So what is ondc? Ondc is an open network that allows any buyer and any seller to transact with each other without any intermediary. It is a decentralized network that is based on open protocols. So how does ondc work? Ondc has two parts. The first part is the buyer side. The buyer side is where the buyers can discover products and services from any seller on the network. The second part is the seller side. The seller side is where the sellers can list their products and services and make them discoverable to any buyer on the network. So let's take an example. Let's say you want to buy a pair of shoes. You go to a buyer side app and you search for shoes. The buyer side app will send a search request to the ondc network. The ondc network will forward the search request to all the seller side apps on the network. The seller side apps will respond with a list of shoes that match your search query. The buyer side app will display the list of shoes to you. You can select the shoes that you want to buy and you can place an order. The buyer side app will send the order to the seller side app. The seller side app will process the order and ship the shoes to you. So this is how ondc works. And ondc is being used for a variety of use cases, like retail, food delivery, mobility, etc. So I think ondc is a great example of how you can build a DPI that can solve the hard problems of a country. Now let's talk about climate change. I think climate change is one of the biggest challenges that we are facing today. And I think we need to use technology to solve this challenge. And I think DPI can play a very important role in solving this challenge. So how can we use DPI for climate change? I think there are two ways. The first way is to use DPI to measure and monitor our carbon footprint. We can use DPI to track the carbon footprint of every individual, every organization, and every country. And we can use this data to create a carbon trading market. The second way is to use DPI to create a market for green products and services. We can use DPI to create a market where consumers can buy green products and services from green producers. And we can use this market to incentivize producers to produce more green products and services. So I think DPI can play a very important role in solving the challenge of climate change. Thank you.



   28. Digital Public Infrastructure: Stacking Up the Benefits  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgnEg4MJvZI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgnEg4MJvZI) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgnEg4MJvZI&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about the benefits of digital public infrastructure. I think the first benefit is that it can help us to achieve the sustainable development goals. The sustainable development goals are a set of 17 goals that were adopted by the United Nations in 2015. And these goals are aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. And I think digital public infrastructure can help us to achieve all of these goals. For example, it can help us to achieve the goal of no poverty by providing financial inclusion to the poor. It can help us to achieve the goal of zero hunger by providing farmers with access to markets and information. It can help us to achieve the goal of good health and well-being by providing people with access to quality healthcare. It can help us to achieve the goal of quality education by providing people with access to quality education. And it can help us to achieve the goal of gender equality by empowering women and girls. So I think digital public infrastructure can help us to achieve all the sustainable development goals. The second benefit of digital public infrastructure is that it can help us to build a more inclusive society. A more inclusive society is a society where everyone has the opportunity to participate and to benefit from the development process. And I think digital public infrastructure can help us to build a more inclusive society by providing everyone with access to identity, finance, and data. And the third benefit of digital public infrastructure is that it can help us to build a more resilient society. A more resilient society is a society that is able to withstand and to recover from shocks and stresses. And I think digital public infrastructure can help us to build a more resilient society by providing us with the tools to respond to crises, like pandemics, natural disasters, and economic downturns. So I think these are the three main benefits of digital public infrastructure. And I think these benefits are very compelling. And I think this is why we are seeing a growing number of countries around the world adopting the digital public infrastructure approach. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> The Nigeria interbank settlement system instant payment or nip is a real-time interbank payment system that was launched in 2011. It is the flagship product of nibs and it has transformed the payment landscape in Nigeria. Nip is a 24/7 service that allows customers to transfer funds from their bank account to any other bank account in Nigeria in real time. The transfer is instant and the beneficiary gets value immediately. Nip is available through various channels including mobile banking, internet banking, and ATMs. Nip has been a phenomenal success. In 2021, nip processed over 2.2 billion transactions worth over 100 trillion naira. This is a testament to the popularity and the utility of the service. Nip has had a significant impact on the Nigerian economy. It has promoted financial inclusion by making it easier for people to send and receive money. It has also facilitated commerce by enabling businesses to make and receive payments in real time. Nip is a world-class payment system and it is a shining example of what can be achieved when the public and the private sector work together.

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about how we can build safe and inclusive DPI. I think the first thing that we need to understand is that DPI is not just about technology. It's about people. And so when we are building DPI, we need to make sure that we are putting people at the center of the design process. We need to make sure that we are building DPI that is inclusive, that is accessible, and that is affordable for everyone. And we also need to make sure that we are building DPI that is safe and secure. So how can we do this? I think there are three things that we need to do. First, we need to have a strong legal and regulatory framework. This framework should protect the rights of individuals and it should also promote competition and innovation. Second, we need to have a strong institutional framework. This framework should ensure that there is a clear division of roles and responsibilities between the different stakeholders. And third, we need to have a strong technical framework. This framework should ensure that the DPI is built on open standards and that it is interoperable with other systems. So I think if we can do these three things, then we can build a DPI that is safe and inclusive. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about the benefits of digital public goods and digital public infrastructure. I think the first thing that we need to understand is what is a digital public good. A digital public good is a digital resource that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. So what does that mean? Non-rivalrous means that one person's use of the resource does not diminish another person's use of the resource. And non-excludable means that it is not possible to prevent anyone from using the resource. So some examples of digital public goods are open source software, open data, and open standards. So what are the benefits of digital public goods? I think there are two main benefits. The first benefit is that they can help us to solve some of the world's most pressing challenges, like climate change, poverty, and inequality. And the second benefit is that they can help us to build a more open and inclusive society. So what is digital public infrastructure? Digital public infrastructure is a set of shared digital systems that are used to deliver a wide range of services to people. These systems are typically owned and operated by the government, but they are open to all, which means that anyone can use them to build new and innovative services. So what are the benefits of digital public infrastructure? I think there are three main benefits. The first benefit is that it can help us to achieve the sustainable development goals. The second benefit is that it can help us to build a more inclusive society. And the third benefit is that it can help us to build a more resilient society. So I think these are the main benefits of digital public goods and digital public infrastructure. And I think these benefits are very compelling. And I think this is why we are seeing a growing number of countries around the world adopting the digital public goods and the digital public infrastructure approach. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> I'm going to talk about payments innovation in Brazil. Brazil has been a hotbed of payments innovation in recent years. And I think there are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that Brazil has a very young and tech-savvy population. The second reason is that the Central Bank of Brazil has been very proactive in promoting payments innovation. So let's talk about some of the payments innovations that have happened in Brazil in recent years. The first innovation is the launch of pix, which is the instant payment system in Brazil. Pix was launched in November 2020 and it has been a huge success. In less than two years, it has become the most popular payment method in Brazil. The second innovation is the launch of open finance. Open finance is a system that allows customers to share their financial data with third-party providers. And this is enabling a lot of innovation in the financial sector. For example, we are seeing new companies that are using open finance to offer new products and services, like personal finance management, credit scoring, and investment advice. The third innovation is the launch of the digital real, which is the central bank digital currency in Brazil. The digital real is still in the pilot phase, but it has the potential to revolutionize the payments landscape in Brazil. So I think these are some of the payments innovations that have happened in Brazil in recent years. And I think these innovations are making the payments system in Brazil more efficient, more inclusive, and more competitive. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about real-time success stories from Brazil, India, and beyond. I think the first thing that we need to understand is what is a real-time payment system. A real-time payment system is a payment system that allows you to transfer money from one bank account to another bank account in real time. So the transfer is instant and the beneficiary gets value immediately. So why are real-time payment systems so important? I think there are two main reasons. The first reason is that they can help us to increase financial inclusion. And the second reason is that they can help us to boost economic growth. So let's talk about some of the real-time success stories from around the world. The first success story is from Brazil. Brazil launched its real-time payment system, pix, in November 2020. And it has been a huge success. In less than two years, it has become the most popular payment method in Brazil. The second success story is from India. India launched its real-time payment system, UPI, in 2016. And it has been a phenomenal success. In 2021, UPI processed over 45 billion transactions worth over $1 trillion. The third success story is from the UK. The UK launched its real-time payment system, faster payments, in 2008. And it has been a very successful system. In 2021, faster payments processed over 3.4 billion transactions worth over £2.6 trillion. So I think these are some of the real-time success stories from around the world. And I think these stories show that real-time payment systems can be a very powerful tool for economic development. Thank you.

Open banking is a system that allows customers to share their financial data with third-party providers. And this is enabling a lot of innovation in the financial sector. For example, we are seeing new companies that are using open banking to offer new products and services, like personal finance management, credit scoring, and investment advice. So how does open banking work? Open banking is based on a set of open APIs that are provided by the banks. These APIs allow any third-party provider to connect to the bank's systems and access the customer's financial data. Of course, the customer has to give their consent before their financial data can be shared with a third-party provider. So open banking is a consent-based data sharing system. And I think this is a very important point. So what are the benefits of open banking? I think there are three main benefits. The first benefit is that it can help us to increase financial inclusion. The second benefit is that it can help us to boost economic growth. And the third benefit is that it can help us to empower consumers. So I think these are the main benefits of open banking. And I think these benefits are very compelling. And I think this is why we are seeing a growing number of countries around the world adopting the open banking approach. Thank you.

   37. An Overview of India’s DPI Story by Dr. Pramod Varma  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR7rJkE6o9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR7rJkE6o9I) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR7rJkE6o9I&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to give you an overview of India's DPI story. I think the first thing that we need to understand is that India is a very large and diverse country. We have a population of over 1.3 billion people. We have 22 official languages. We have a very diverse culture. And we have a very complex federal structure. So building a DPI for India was a very challenging task. But we did it. And we did it by following a very simple principle. And that principle is to build a set of minimal, interoperable, and reusable building blocks. So what are these building blocks? There are three building blocks. The first building block is the identity layer. The second building block is the payments layer. And the third building block is the data layer. So let's talk about each of these building blocks. The identity layer is the foundation of the India Stack. It is a unique, digital, and verifiable identity for every Indian resident. It is called Aadhaar. The payments layer is built on top of the identity layer. It is a unified payments interface or UPI. UPI is a real-time payment system that allows you to transfer money from one bank account to another bank account in real time. The data layer is built on top of the identity layer and the payments layer. It is a consent-based data sharing system. It is called the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture or DEPA. So these are the three building blocks of the India Stack. And these three building blocks are working together to create a presence-less, paperless, and cashless service delivery in India. And we are seeing some amazing innovation happening on top of the India Stack. We are seeing new business models, new products, and new services being built on top of the India Stack. And we are seeing a lot of financial inclusion happening because of the India Stack. So I think the India Stack is a great example of how you can build a DPI that can solve the hard problems of a country. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> So I'm going to talk about the evolution and the journey towards DPI. I think the first thing that we need to understand is that DPI is not a new concept. It has been around for many years. But it has been called by different names. It has been called e-government, it has been called digital government, it has been called government as a platform. But the core idea is the same. And that core idea is to use technology to deliver better services to people. So what has changed? I think what has changed is that the technology has become much more powerful and much more affordable. And so we are now able to do things that were not possible before. For example, we are now able to provide a unique digital identity to every person on the planet. We are now able to provide a real-time payment system that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime. And we are now able to provide a consent-based data sharing system that can empower people to control their own data. So I think the technology has changed. And the other thing that has changed is that the political will has changed. I think there is a growing recognition around the world that we need to use technology to solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. And so we are seeing a growing number of countries around the world adopting the DPI approach. So I think we are at a very exciting time in history. I think we have the opportunity to build a better world, a more inclusive world, a more resilient world. And I think DPI can play a very important role in building that world. Thank you.
