ountries all over the world are facing an uphill 
battle to help citizens protect themselves against 
economic shocks caused by climate change, global 
geopolitical fractures, and pandemics while also 
supporting inclusive and climate-resilient growth. 
For governments in developing economies, these battles 
are harder, and the options fewer.
The IMF estimates that low-income developing coun-
tries need $3 trillion annually through 2030 to finance 
their development goals and the climate transition. And 
with global debt projected to reach 100 percent of GDP 
before the end of this decade, borrowing to finance these 
investments may not be the soundest choice. Given that 
these countries have an untapped tax potential of 8–9 per-
cent of GDP, collecting more revenue through taxation is 
a better solution. 
Yet  increasing  tax  revenue  is  a  major  challenge  in  
poorer countries. A large share of the population works

 in difficult-to-tax activities such as small-holder 
farming and as informal service providers, such as 
street vendors. It is difficult for the government to 
track these earnings because they are largely cash-
based. These workers often believe that joining the 
formal sector will only bring them greater tax liabil-
ity and limited benefits. They prefer to keep busi-
nesses small and informal.
To grow their industries, governments often 
resort to offering tax exemptions to large corpo
-
rations, which erodes the corporate tax base and 
strengthens vested interests. Consequently, such 
countries rely mainly on taxes on goods and ser-
vices, which place a heavier burden on the poor. 
Moreover, revenue collection is too often charac-
terized by enforcement that is weak for the rich and 
punitive for the working class and the poor. 
Delivering value 
We  propose  a  different  and  more  sustainable  
approach to increasing domestic revenue in devel-
oping economies. This approach is founded on the 
belief that how governments drive increases in tax 
collection is integral to how much tax they can col-
lect. The approach is based on strengthening the 
social contract and encouraging individuals and 
businesses to formalize their economic activities, 
with early lessons from India.
A recent World Bank report—supported by fund-
ing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—
presents a tax administration framework in which 
governments  augment  their  efforts  to  improve  
enforcement with efforts to build trust by generat-
ing social value for their citizens. Generating value 
as a tax reform strategy is especially important in 
poorer countries, where trust in tax authorities is 
limited, compliance is poor, and political support 
for taxation is low.
The report, “Innovations in Tax Compliance: 
Building Trust, Navigating Politics, and Tailoring 
Reform,” examines how tax reform has tradition-
ally sought to strengthen enforcement by detect-
ing tax evasion better and imposing higher penal-
ties. It proposes an alternative approach that places 
greater emphasis on fostering trust between tax-
payers and governments by delivering value to peo-
ple—in other words, taxpayers derive some benefit 
in exchange for paying taxes. If being part of the 
formal economy delivers value to individuals, they 
will be more inclined to formalize their businesses 
and pay appropriate taxes.      
India’s case

structure is an approach to providing services and 
economic opportunities to citizens by combining 
interoperable, open-access, and reusable building 
blocks into a network of digital systems. It can be 
compared to roads and other physical infrastruc-
ture that connect people and give them access to 
goods and services. Digital public infrastructure 
combines innovative technology with strong pol-
icy frameworks and incentives for private market 
participation. Data security, privacy, and consent 
are at its heart.
Individuals  and  businesses  may  resist  filing  
taxes because they see it as a costly compliance 
burden. Staying out of the system—by using cash 
for informal transactions or not disclosing assets—
is often more convenient than joining the formal 
economy. Digital public infrastructure can turn this 
thinking on its head and thereby unlock durable 
increases in tax collection. We identify three steps 
that can help governments collect more revenue 
from and broaden the tax base. 
First, introduce digitally verifiable assets and 
credentials that make it less desirable to operate 
outside the formal economy and tax system. For 
instance, Aadhaar, in India, provides unique and 
verifiable digital identification numbers. Among 
other things, this has enabled individuals and 
businesses  to  open  bank  accounts.  It  has  also  
reduced public spending by making social ben
-
efit payments seamless. Brazil’s Pix, Thailand’s 
PromptPay, and India’s Unified Payments Inter-
face make digital payments cheap and effortless. 
And digitally signed documents and certificates, 
which are independently verifiable by third par-
ties, can make issuing licenses and permits more 
straightforward.
Second, align incentives for individuals and 
businesses to join the formal sector. People should 
see the process of joining the formal sector as gen-
erating  value  for  them,  first  and  foremost.  For  
example, by reducing the cost of business verifica-
tion, digital payment footprints and verifiable busi-
ness credentials can help individuals and small and 
medium enterprises gain access to formal credit at 
competitive rates. In time, the increased volume of 
payment records will also lead to more transparent 
tax collection—but this must be a secondary, not a 
primary, aim. (For example, if a payment network 
is launched with the explicit objective of linking 
all transactions on the network to tax reporting, it 
could discourage businesses and people from using 
that infrastructure.) 
Third, generate value for individuals and busi-
nesses through the tax system. The first two steps 
make it less beneficial for taxpayers to stay out of 
the formal tax system. However, countries still 
Trust and Taxation
Trust in government and government effectiveness 
have a reciprocal relationship. Trust is enhanced when 
political institutions are strong and governments 
implement policies and initiatives that are aligned with 
the public interest and improve people’s daily lives. And 
governments can be effective only when their citizens 
trust them enough to comply with laws, thereby 
creating the space for reforms. 
Of course, trust in government needs more than just 
robust digital platforms. But the building of India’s 
digital platform infrastructure has laid some of 
the foundations for increasing trust by creating an 
inclusive platform for citizens to transact digitally and 
empowering users to have more control over their data. 
Good digital infrastructure can create trust between 
any two counterpart actors by introducing tamper-
proof components for identity, payments, and security, 
which allows citizens and businesses to be certain of 
the identity of their counterpart and of the legitimacy 
of the transaction. This allows the reduction in explicit 
and implicit costs to citizens when they interact 
with their government, and for businesses in their 
transactions with individuals, other businesses, and the 
government.
Trust can also be built in the overall system through 
other channels, such as the reliability of its functioning 
or swift and transparent dispute resolution. Countries 
need to make sustained progress in strengthening 
digital systems as well as broader policy and 
institutional frameworks to strengthen trust between 
citizens and the state. In turn, this will increase 
confidence in the economy and boost investment, 
innovation, productivity—and ultimately growth.

need to generate value for businesses to engage 
with the tax filing system, in particular—which can 
reward compliant filers in various ways: 
Give data back to taxpayers. Data is an asset 
that should be used confidentially and ethically. It 
should also be given back to taxpayers in a format 
they trust, so that they can reuse it to access key 
services. For instance, in India, the tax collection 
department provides compliant taxpayers with 
digitally signed (tamper-proof ) business IDs they 
can use as digital know-your-customer credentials. 
The tax authorities also designed a public verifica-
tion mechanism to check core business registration 
facts associated with a goods and services tax (GST) 
ID number, helping businesses build trust with pro-
spective partners. 
Create incentives for filing taxes throughout 
the supply chain. Regarding India’s GST, the tax 
department offers businesses an income tax credit 
discount of up to 20 percent if they purchase goods 
and services from suppliers also registered and 
paying tax. This discount applies throughout the 
supply-chain networks as an incentive for busi-
nesses to join the formal tax system. To encour-
age repeated and timely tax filings, the discount 
is shared not as cash back but as a credit toward 
the next tax payment.
Allow the private ecosystem to build seamless 
filing and value-added services. Opening up use 
of application programming interfaces (APIs) in 
the tax system would allow private innovators to 
build unique digital and physical user experiences 
for tax filing that combine services and save time 
for filers. This is a market incentive for private 
competition based on ease of filing that caters to 
diverse user needs and drives digitalization. Since 
the Indian government opened API access, more 
than 55 licensed third-party platforms have been 
used to file taxes. 
‘Value-first’ lens
India has successfully leveraged digital public 
infrastructure—revenue collection via the goods 
and services tax has grown by more than 50 basis 
points  of  GDP  since  2018,  showing  a  marked  
increase over projected collections under the pre-
vious tax regime (see Chart 1). The time it takes 
to process electronic returns and refunds for tax-
payers has fallen significantly (see Chart 2). And 
the tax base has broadened, with a marked and 
sustained rise in noncorporate taxpayers, includ-
ing small businesses and individuals (see Chart 
3). A crucial element of India’s digital success is 
the system’s robust security and privacy controls, 
which ensure that the government uses taxpayer 
data confidentially and ethically.
Improvements in revenue collection cannot, 
however, be attributed to technology alone. Gov-
ernance and policy reforms are also critical. For 
instance,  India  set  up  the  Goods  and  Services  
Tax Network as a unified collection mechanism 
intended to simplify tax compliance and adminis-
tration for businesses of all sizes.
In summary, sustainable increases in revenue 
mobilization result when governments’ systems 
and processes provide value to people and busi
-
nesses, and tax collection increases gradually over 
time as a derivative benefit. As digital transactions 
become an integral part of business and life, it is 
more difficult for people to evade the system. Mov-
ing from an enforcement-of-collection lens to a val-
ue-first lens is a promising new way to drive lasting 
increases in revenue collection and encourage a 
more trusted social contract between individuals 
and the government. F&D
