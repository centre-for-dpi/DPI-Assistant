# VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALING INFRASTRUCTURE 

**DaaS Scope Document Template for Digital Verifiable Credentials Implementation**

**Template for [Country Name]**

## Context
This is a sample technical scope template for implementing verifiable credentials as part of DPI (Digital Public Infrastructure) as a packaged solution program. This template can be used as a reference for any general implementation of verifiable credentials DPI in sovereign nations.

## Key Sections

### 1. INTRODUCTION
Credentials offer a mechanism for low-cost, high-trust, user-centric data sharing. This document provides a comprehensive framework for implementing verifiable credentials infrastructure at country scale.

### 2. SOLUTION APPROACH TO CREDENTIALING DPI
The solution is divided into four broad modules:
- **Issuance**: Open loop VC issuance platforms
- **Store**: Inclusive approach to credential stores  
- **Acceptance**: Verifications SDK
- **Supporting Trust Infrastructure**: Schema registries, issuer directories

### 3. KEY REQUIREMENTS

#### Functional Requirements (Technical/Program)
- CI-01 to CI-13: Credential Issuance capabilities
- CV-01 to CV-09: Credential Verification capabilities  
- CS-01 to CS-03: Credential Store capabilities
- PR-101 to PR-908: Program requirements

#### Non-Functional Requirements (Technical)
- NFR-01 to NFR-10: Security, performance, and operational requirements

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION MODELS
Three models for offering VC issuance capability:
1. **SDK Offering** - Provide SDK/Libraries for issuers
2. **SaaS Offering** - ISV hosted services on cloud platforms
3. **Hosted Offering** - Customer-controlled infrastructure

### 5. USE CASE POSSIBILITIES
- Climate: Carbon credits as verifiable credentials
- Education: Digital certificates and transcripts
- Healthcare: Vaccination records, professional licensing
- Banking: Bank statements, transaction records
- Government Services: Digital identity documents
- Business: Trade licenses, tax certificates

### 6. TECHNICAL DELIVERABLES
- Deployment and Integration of all components
- Functionality and Performance optimization
- User Experience enhancement
- Credential Types and Storage support
- L1, L2 and L3 Operational Support
- Stakeholder Satisfaction metrics
- Continuous Improvement processes
- Training and Transition Support
- Data Portability capabilities

### 7. PROJECT GOVERNANCE
- Operational cadence: daily
- Internal steering committee reviews: every 4 weeks
- Operation + program progress review: every 6 weeks

### 8. QUALIFICATION & EVALUATION CRITERIA
Comprehensive criteria for service providers including:
- Company registration and financial stability
- Qualified manpower requirements
- In-country capability and experience
- Technical understanding and compliance
- Project management capabilities

## Standards Compliance
- W3C Verifiable Credentials standards
- Open schema specifications
- Global interoperability standards
- Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) support

## Key Benefits
1. **Empower individuals**: User-controlled data sharing
2. **Build efficiency**: Streamlined verification processes
3. **Enable inclusion**: Multi-modal access options
4. **Support growth**: Reduced barriers to services

This template provides a comprehensive framework for countries looking to implement verifiable credentials infrastructure as part of their digital public infrastructure strategy.
