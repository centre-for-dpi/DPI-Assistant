Verifiable Credentials - Why, What and 
How?


1

Data is the most powerful 
economic asset in digital 
age for individuals and 
businesses! 



Free, user controlled flow 
of trusted, verifiable data 
is key to unlock growth!
Identity & Identity 
related data
Certificates and 
Documents  
Affiliations & 
entitlements data 
Transactional data 
2

Lack of verifiable 
certificates is a 
hidden root cause 
of exclusion from 
key services & 
opportunities



Government 
Benefits
Loans & 
Insurance
Healthcare
Employment

Business 
Licenses &
Bank Statements

Any data sharing strategy should 
scale across govt-held certificates
... and also 
privately held certs!
Identity cards
Tax returns
Vaccine Certs
Public School 
Transcripts
Land records
Bank 
Statements
Hospital 
Records
Employer 
Certificates
Schools/ University 
DIplomas
eCommerce 
records
Agri-tech

For humanity scale and 
unlimited cross border usage 
we must place user at the 
centre of the of the data flow.
Current bilateral sharing 
infrastructures has its 
limitations.

Higher technical capacity, 
dependency on holder, 
exclusionary tendencies and 
more!

N: M bilateral integrations 
Single integration with the user
User centric data sharing can help save decades & 
millions and accelerate cross border flow of data!

A User-Centric Approach to Data Sharing via Verifiable 
Credentials 
Credential Owner’s 
‘Inboxes’/Wallets/ eLockers


Credential 
Issuers
Credential Users/
Service Providers
Shares onward flexibly
Banks, Hospitals, 
Government 
Depts, Schools, 
Businesses...
Banks, Insurers, 
Govt Dept’s, 
Employers...
Verifies
Gives credentialed data back 
to user
Machine readable  & Digitally Signed

Digitally signed
Tamper-proof & Trusted
Machine readable
Allows low cost review
Verifiable 
credentials are 
cryptographically 
secured data 
adhering to 
schemas and 
standards
Make data
High trust at
Low cost

Universal trust 
Anyone can verify 
authenticity

Issued to Any ‘Inbox’
Paper binder, e-locker, digital 
wallet, or email!
Issued to a “holder”
Binded to an individual, 
authentication protocols

This is a proven strategy!

Today, 9.26 Billion 
verifiable certificates 
are used by 
464 M+ people

people in just 65 
days 
EUs digital wallet 
can store user’s 
credentials and 
digitally sign 
docs

You can implement this data 
sharing infrastructure for any 
use case in just 100 days!

Organizations publish (issuers, 
revocations, schema, etc)
Share through preferred channel of the 
user/holder (email, messaging apps, web 
portals, APIs) after authentication
Stores or receives credentials 
in a format of choice (Physical, 
Digital (local store, cloud store, 
locker service), Wallet)
Issuer of 
certificate
(Custodian of the 
data)
Data retained in an attested data store
Digitally signs the credential using its 
private key
Generates on request (or just in time / in 
bulk)
Issues in any format (docs, paper based, 
digital, image)
Maintains a revocation registry (to reflect 
the current status of an issued credential)
Accepting 
party
(Gov, Private, 
NGO)
Verifies authenticity of the 
integrity of the document using 
the issuer’s public key
Verifies the identity of the issuer, 
and the identity of the holder as 
required
Checks the revocation list

The holder presents the credential to 
an accepting party to access a service 
through a preferred channel
Receives the requested service 
(gov, healthcare, education, 
banking, employment, others)
Requests for a 
credential (or is 
issued one)

Trust Infra
(Shared trust 
anchors)

Key) in a Decentralized 
Directory

Verifiable Credentials ecosystem 
follows a multilayered approach to 
trust!

Issuers can publish 
public revocation 
lists of revoked 
credentials to 
avoid misuse   

Choice of user 
wallets catering to 
different 
segments of 
population 

Standardised 
specifications for 
verifying the user 
during issuing and 
presenting VCs 

All VCs are 
digitally signed 
and can be 
verified by 
anyone.
15

Credentials can drive exponential outcomes 
because of its scalability, universality & 
inclusivity.  

1.Scalable: Decentralised issuance and low integration costs
2.Universal: Anyone can issue and verify a document 
3.Inclusive: Multi-modal of issuance and storage.
