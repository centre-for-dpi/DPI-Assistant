**Video Transcript:**
> So thanks, Teresa. So my name is Emmanuel Gisa, and I'm the Africa Director for the Center for Digital Public Infrastructure. Wonderful. So tell us, Emmanuel, what does this center do? So CDPI is a pro bono tech advisory facility housed within IIITB, Bangalore. And what we help, we do is to help countries to design better systems and ensure that DPI is widespread across the world. It's a global South-South initiative. And one of the key areas where we intervene is in sitting with governments and supporting them to design solutions that are open, interoperable, and privacy by design. What African countries are you working with? So we currently work with about seven African countries. Zambia is our lead country in the continent. We also have Uganda, which is closing as a close second. We have Nigeria, Malawi, Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Wonderful. Yes. So I've read a little bit about the work that you've done in Zambia. Tell us a little bit about the success there. Yes. So one of the – so Zambia was obviously the first country that we tried to engage when the center was moving into Africa. We found an ecosystem that did not have electronic KYC, and we needed to support them. They had great ambitions. And for people who don't know what KYC is. Okay. So electronic know your customer is a way to digitally verify the identity of a customer that you're engaging and that you're working with. And that's for a bank. And it is for a bank primarily. But in Zambia, we've had an expanded use case and scope. And so we have one of the digital health platforms using the same electronic KYC platform. We also have the government's social protection fund for the drought victims, victims of the worst drought in Zambia in 100 years. And so that drought intervention program is utilizing this same electronic KYC to help with identification of beneficiaries and also disbursement of the – yeah. So I think I cut you off, and that's where you were going with this, explaining to our audience what the benefit of a more sophisticated KYC platform is, the benefit to society is Yes. So the benefit of an eKYC is that it's parts innovation. And in a digital sense, because you then are able to build solutions within the ecosystem, including FinTech, including InsureTech, including EdTech, solutions that help to deliver services faster and reliably to the community. One of the obvious financial benefits, for example, for the Zambia ecosystem has been the potential for this to be used for loans application for students who are applying for government scholarship. And so it makes it easier for the government to be able to provide the funding to students in universities primarily, and also in Tivet colleges. Tivet has technical vocational training centers. So we're talking about electronic KYC, but let's back up just a little bit, because when we – you're here discussing digital public infrastructure, and that's one important component of it. Yes. But if we peel back the layer and just start at the most foundational level for DPI, a country needs to also have strong power and internet before you can even get there. Yes. So can you comment in Zambia, did you already find that foundation in place? So we did, and it's interesting that you mentioned this. I think it takes us back to the whole philosophical conversation around DPI and what to do when you're looking at how best to – what are the prerequisites for a successful deployment. And the irony is that Zambia's actually had their worst drought in 100 years, by extension because their power generation is hydro. They've also then had to contend with serious number of hours in a day of blackout. And then you load on top of that that impact of the drought and power outage on connectivity, and you have a real case for DPI not to work, right? In the same sense, I think the intentionality behind it, the drive behind it has meant – one of the things that's happened is we've had sort of a country that is so committed against all odds to make tech work. So for example, they very early on on the continent adopted Starlink. Right after Nigeria, it was Zambia that took on Starlink and made sure that there's coverage across the country. They have some incredible government-driven infrastructure solutions. One is called Infratel, which is the telecoms company that has towers across the country, and the widest spread of towers in Zambia is actually driven from the government-owned Infratel, which runs as a separate entity subsidiary. And on the power side, they've had to prioritize some of those critical service areas. So there's been very minimal disruption. And then to sort of mitigate against all that power problem, they've had to partner with China, of course, to do very large-scale solar intervention for the country. And so solar for the first time has been brought on board and has been made available as wide as possible within the country, which is a great learning for them. So these are not DPI questions, but they are obviously sort of, to say, a very intentional approach to making sure that you're actually delivering for your DPI needs, which will require power and they'll require internet and they'll require stability of the same. So to that extent, yes, one of the philosophical elements is that DPI requires connectivity to thrive. But beyond that philosophical element, I think DPI also requires political will and drive to thrive. So the successes, yes, there's the infrastructure, the physical rails that it runs upon, but it's also the powerful political statement of champions that push the DPI agenda. I want to follow up with one of the comments you made about connectivity. Do you have a view that we can achieve these DPI objectives over wireless, or do you think that we have to have broadband cable in order to have the speeds necessary to achieve the objectives? I think the evidence actually points to possibilities of wireless being what you need. So at the risk of being too Zambia-centric, it's a vast country with sparse population sat there. There is Tanzania as well. It's a vast country, again, very concentrated population centers to the contrary. And many other countries that have had to adopt wireless. Starlink has demonstrated much higher speeds than most of the fiber connectivity solutions that are available within most metro fiber ecosystems in the continent. And so I do believe that the wireless wired gap is narrowing. We are starting to see just as good decent speeds on wireless as we have had on fiber in the metros. So this is, to my mind, I think it's possible. There are other elements around it. I mean, issues around access, which to my mind comes down to cost, comes down to elements around technology applied to access. So are you using USSD, for example? Is that technology appropriate for the context that you're working with, or is the technology more driven by the smartphone type applications? And what I would say there is that we still have to figure out the need to have appropriate tech for this population. So where you have feature phone access, for example, it allows you to drive some of this adoption at a very low level in the rural areas where you don't only have low connectivity rates, but you also have low access to smartphone devices. So I think the smart devices could be a distraction. The over-emphasis on the same, because you may not then get to a level and scale that you may want. But if you can build DPI technologies that still work on USSD or work on a simple feature phone, as was the case with mobile money, for example, which is scalable and appropriate even where you apply assisted tech for the communities. Those are some of the thought processes that I think on the Africa side, it's nuanced. So one of the questions that people had was, what is the difference between Africa and India in that instance? And I think at the risk of preempting it, I think there's a possibility to oversimplify the comparisons between the two areas. But two main ones, I think the fact that in India, it's one country. In Africa, you're dealing with 54 different countries, 40 different currencies. And you're also dealing with a not so widespread, cheap access to smartphone and towers and internet, when in India already, they had free calls by certain points in their DPI journey. Yeah. I have so many questions for you. You've said so many. Your comments are so rich, and we're so privileged to speak with you today. Coming back to this question around the essentials of power and connectivity, do you think that it makes sense for African governments to be thinking about various applications before they have achieved the goals that they need to achieve relative to power and connectivity? In other words, does it need to be sequenced? Or should another investment be made in the applications before investments are made in advancing power and connectivity? Do you have to get power and connectivity in place first? So it depends on how you perceive it. And I think it's interesting because in the African context, there's the view we hold, or many people hold, that, oh my God, vast parts of this continent are not covered. OK? But from a GSMA study, I think the question should be framed differently. There is the coverage gap, usage gap, and access gap. And so if you think about it from a coverage gap standpoint, the gap has pretty much narrowed in many ways, whereby for the most part, many countries already have. The dark spots have reduced. I mean, the spaces without any connectivity at all. And that leaves you with usage, which is a factor of cost and affordability, and access, which is a factor of device or lack thereof of devices. And so I think that the most important elements for us to consider is to almost scale the stairs and chew gum at the same time for most of these countries, because it's a case of you can't be left behind. You can't have your young people growing up in a space, an environment that doesn't empower and provide tech for them. But at the same time, you can't be in an environment that is in the dark, so without power. So it's almost an imperative. I think it also creates that sense of urgency is helpful, because it creates creativity. The necessity of it breeds creativity so much so that as you set up your power infrastructure, you need to combine it with fiber that runs along that power line so that as you're reaching the homes, you're actually delivering a triple or dual play. So you're either landing in electricity and fiber for internet, but you could also be landing educational content. So you're landing so much more. And if you think about how we have evolved through the 90s into the new millennia and all these things, you then almost start to think and feel that we leapfrogged the whole telephone, wired telephony era and just jumped. And all of a sudden, about 400 million Africans then got to be connected on the telephone when previously you had maybe less than 5 million telephones in homes. So I think that there's a possibility there that whereas, yes, we do not have access in many ways to electricity or the electricity access is unstable, these provide opportunities for smarter devices that use solar to charge them and smarter devices that allow for homes to be wired and connected through solar-powered lighting or schools to be connected through solar-powered lighting. And all these opportunities then present more scope, faster speed to access here. Another question from something you said. You'd mentioned how we mustn't be distracted by the lack of access to smartphones and that there's a fair bit you can do without them with just feature phones. And you gave a very good example of mobile money, which started in your home country in Kenya with Mpesa. Can you give some other examples of applications that one can use on feature phones without the need to have a smartphone? Because that's a very effective one that you mentioned. Yeah, so I think that there's been the power of financial services. I think DFS is one area that we've witnessed lots of access and transformation from even if you discount for mobile money, I mean, even just mobile banking, where interaction between the bank and the customer issues on two-factor authentication, where you can still implement security features of various applications and services using any type of phone. If you look at Ag, which is another space where applications can be accessed using USSD. And so by dialing a short code, you're able to receive either information or closes Agrovet or share information about your harvest and how much you have available for sale for the market. And so on and so forth. So there's lots of innovation that is still possible to be implemented using feature phones and USSD sort of low-level tech. I think I'm not saying that there's no use in place for smartphones and all that stuff. But I think the notion that you need all of these things before you get started, then means that, oh, let's just wait or let's look for a $50 billion master plan to get Africa having the devices that they need to then move forward, which I think is problematic. Because we also discount for all these possibilities that we may be dealing with literacy levels that are still low. You're dealing with much more enhanced power needs. You're dealing with much more enhanced connectivity needs because all the smartphones come with their own demand and drain on data. And do you then extrapolate it to cost and the cost are just way out of reach for the average person trying to balance between the

And so by dialing a short code, you're able to receive either information or closes aggrevate or share information about your harvest and how much you have available for sale for the market. And so on and so forth. So there's lots of innovation that is still possible to be implemented using feature phones and USSD sort of low-level tech.

You're dealing with much more enhanced connectivity needs because all the smartphones come with their own demand and drain on data. And you then extrapolate it to cost. And the costs are just way out of reach for the average person trying to balance between the  for food and maybe $3 or $4 for 1,000 MB of data. I like what you're saying, which is another way of saying, don't let great be the enemy of good. Yes. If we can do some good, do it. If we can get started. I mean, if the digital financial sector focused on, oh my God, we have to have Java-enabled funds before we do anything, then you'd never have moved the needle on access to financial services. Let's talk a little bit about African empowerment in terms of this whole DPI movement. I think you have some interesting thoughts there. Can you share some thoughts? Yeah, yeah. So thanks for that. I think the reality we have here is that nobody's coming to save Africa in a sense. I think we are in a very interesting time as a continent where I think belief in self, belief in our own abilities to have answers to our problems and from mobile monies rise and rise, we can see that, okay, the continent needed solution. We know as a continent what solutions would work for us. We know where the shoe pinches in a sense. We know where the shoe pinches in a sense. So my view is that we need to continuously build tech and DPI that responds to our needs. My dream is to see more and more of our young entrepreneurs, young developers building solutions for this continent with their context in mind because someone from outside may never have the context that we are even dealing with access issues or connectivity issues. They may be building with the assumption that all that is sorted out. So take this solution or leave it. But we have an opportunity to build based on that local understanding, local wiring, local ability to say, if I have to walk to school, how can I build a solution that helps that child who's walking to school be safe as they walk to school and also to be able to alert the village in case of danger. Such kind of solutions only come from your own understanding of the reality on the ground. And I think my hope is for the continent that we begin to have that belief in ourselves, believe that we can do it. One last question for you. As a Kenyan, Kenya has often been considered the Silicon Savannah of Africa. We've talked about what's happening in other countries. Tell us a little bit about where you see DPI in Kenya because we know that there's a lot of development there, a lot of entrepreneurial activity, a lot of high-tech skills. Where is Kenya in all of this? Wow, wow, Teresa. I think Kenya's had good leadership on tech, but I think that's been taken for granted. I think that it's almost digressed to my mind because there's a sense to which talent exists and there's great talent, but there is a gap in leadership. Remember what I talked about the role of leadership in driving forward adoption and even scale of DPI. You need leadership. I think there is a sense to which Kenya, in the space we are in at the moment, as DPI is taking off, we are not getting the leadership in the right spaces that can then help us to navigate, can help the younger people to build solutions. I attended a very illuminating hackathon two months back and I was quite impressed. I'd become very discouraged that, oh my God, where's all this talent? Where did it go? The young people were very switched on. I was so impressed by the technology, the solution that was coming out, but then I said there's a gap because there can't be this many solutions that are being brought forth by these young people. It was a hackathon and they were supposed to build something in 24, actually, no, just over 24 hours, maybe 36 hours. They came up with some really, really solid solution. Needless to say, they were more oriented around civic engagement and all that, but I was quite impressed at their speed, at how many there were. I mean, this hackathon, we didn't expect more than 50, but there was, I think, 90 enrollments that came through from the developer community. I said, this is impressive, just needs to be harnessed. If I cast my mind at the time when the leadership that Kenya provided on tech and all these things existed, I think there was a great sense to which political will, political leadership and ministerial levels were very much switched on. I mean, there's a change of guard now and our hope is they probably will take a bit more forward-looking approach to harness all this talent that existed in the country for greater good. Manuel, thank you so much. You are clearly one of the continent's leaders in this space and it's our privilege to be able to sit down and speak with you and learn about your views on DPI in Africa today. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

> So thanks, Teresa. So my name is Emmanuel Gisa, and I'm the Africa Director for the Center for Digital Public Infrastructure. Wonderful. So tell us, Emmanuel, what does the center do? So CDPI is a pro bono tech advisory facility housed within IIITB, Bangalore. And what we help, we do is to help countries to design better systems and ensure that DPI is widespread across the world. It's a global South-South initiative. And one of the key areas where we intervene is in sitting with governments and supporting them to design solutions that are open, interoperable, and privacy by design. What African countries are you working with? So we currently work with about seven African countries. Zambia is our lead country in the continent. We also have Uganda, which is closing as a close second. We have Nigeria, Malawi, Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Wonderful. Yes. So I've read a little bit about the work that you've done in Zambia. Tell us a little bit about the success there. Yes. So one of the – so Zambia was obviously the first country that we tried to engage when we – when the center was moving into Africa. We found an ecosystem that did not have electronic KYC, and we needed to support them. They had great ambitions. And for people who don't know what KYC is. Okay. So electronic know your customer is a way to digitally verify the identity of a customer that you're engaging and that you're working with. And that's for a bank. And it is for a bank primarily. But in Zambia, we've had an expanded use case and scope. And so we have one of the digital health platforms using the same electronic KYC platform. We also have the government's social protection fund for the drought victims, victims of the worst drought in Zambia in 100 years. And so that drought intervention program is utilizing this same electronic KYC to help with identification of beneficiaries and also disbursement of the – yeah. So I think I cut you off. Yes. And that's where you were going with this, explaining to our audience what the benefit of a more sophisticated KYC platform is, the benefit to society is. Yes. So the benefit of an eKYC is that it's parts innovation. And in a digital sense, because you then are able to build solutions within the ecosystem, including FinTech, including InsureTech, including EdTech, solutions that help to deliver services faster and reliably to the community. One of the obvious financial benefits, for example, for the Zambia ecosystem has been the potential for this to be used for loans application for students who are applying for government scholarship. And so it makes it easier for the government to be able to provide the funding to students in universities primarily, and also in Tivet colleges. Tivet has technical vocational training centers. Yeah. So we're talking about electronic KYC, but let's back up just a little bit, because we're here discussing digital public infrastructure, and that's one important component of it. But if we peel back the layer and just start at the most foundational level for DPI, a country needs to also have strong power and internet before you can even get there. So can you comment in Zambia, did you already find that foundation in place? So we did. And it's interesting that you mentioned this. I think it takes us back to the whole philosophical conversation around DPI and what to do when you're looking at how best to, what are the prerequisites for a successful deployment? And the irony is that Zambia has actually had their worst drought in 100 years, by extension, because their power generation is hydro. They've also then had to contend with serious number of hours in a day of blackout. And then you load on top of that, that impact of the drought and power outage on connectivity, and you have a real case for DPI not to work, right? In the same sense, I think the intentionality behind it, the drive behind it has meant one of the things that's happened is we've had sort of a country that is so committed against all odds to make tech work. So for example, they very early on on the continent adopted Starlink. Right after Nigeria, it was Zambia that took on Starlink and made sure that there's coverage across the country. They have some incredible government-driven infrastructure solutions. One is called Infratel, which is the telecoms company that has towers across the country, and the widest spread of towers in Zambia is actually driven from the government-owned Infratel, which runs as a separate entity subsidiary. And on the power side, they've had to prioritize some of those critical service areas. So there's been very minimal disruption. And then to sort of mitigate against all that power problem, they've had to partner with China, of course, to do very large-scale solar intervention for the country. And so solar for the first time has been brought on board and has been made available as wide as possible within the country, which is a great learning for them. So these are not DPI questions, but they are obviously sort of, to say, a very intentional approach to making sure that you're actually delivering for your DPI needs, which will require power and they'll require internet and they'll require stability of the same. So to that extent, yes, one of the philosophical elements is that DPI requires connectivity to thrive. But beyond that philosophical element, I think DPI also requires political will and drive to thrive. So the successes, yes, there's the infrastructure, the physical rails that it runs upon, but it's also the powerful political statement of champions that push the DPI agenda. I want to follow up with one of the comments you made about connectivity. Do you have a view that we can achieve these DPI objectives over wireless, or do you think that we have to have broadband cable in order to have the speeds necessary to achieve the objectives? I think the evidence actually points to possibilities of wireless being what you need. So at the risk of being too Zambia-centric, it's a vast country with sparse population sat there. There is Tanzania as well. It's a vast country, again, very concentrated population centers to the contrary. And many other countries that have had to adopt wireless. Starlink has demonstrated much higher speeds than most of the fiber connectivity solutions that are available within most metro fiber ecosystems in the continent. So I do believe that the wireless wired gap is narrowing. We are starting to see just as good decent speeds on wireless as we have had on fiber in the metros. So this is, to my mind, I think it's possible. The other elements around it, I mean, issues around access, which to my mind comes down to cost, comes down to elements around technology applied to access. So are you using USSD, for example? Is that technology appropriate for the context that you're working with? Or is the technology more driven by the smartphone type applications? And what I would say there is that we still have to figure out the need to have appropriate tech for this population. So where you have feature phone access, for example, it allows you to drive some of this adoption at a very low level in the rural areas where you don't only have low connectivity rates, but you also have low access to smartphone devices. So I think the smart devices could be a distraction. I over-emphasize on the same because you may not then get to a level and scale that you may want. But if you can build DPI technologies that still work on USSD or work on a simple feature phone, as was the case with mobile money, for example, which is scalable and appropriate even where you apply assisted tech for the communities. Those are some of the thought processes that I think on the Africa side, it's nuanced. So one of the questions that people had was, what is the difference between Africa and India in that instance? And I think without the risk of preempting it, I think there's a possibility to oversimplify the comparisons between the two areas. But two main ones, I think the fact that in India, it's one country. In Africa, you're dealing with 54 different countries, 40 different currencies, and you're also dealing with a not so widespread cheap access to smartphone and towers and internet when in India already they had free calls by certain points in their DPI journey. Yeah. I have so many questions for you. You've said so many. Your comments are so rich, and we're so privileged to speak with you today. Coming back to this question around the essentials of power and connectivity, do you think that it makes sense for African governments to be thinking about various applications before they have achieved the goals that they need to achieve relative to power and connectivity? In other words, does it need to be sequenced? Or should another investment be made in the applications before investments are made in advancing power and connectivity? You have to get power and connectivity in place first. So it depends on how you perceive it. And I think it's interesting because in the African context, there's the view we hold, or many people hold, that, oh my God, vast parts of this continent are not covered. Okay? But there's, from a GSMA study, I think the question should be framed differently. There's the coverage gap, usage gap, and access gap. And so if you think about it from a coverage gap standpoint, the gap has pretty much narrowed in many ways, whereby for the most part, many countries already have the dark spots have reduced. I mean, the spaces without any connectivity at all. Then that leaves you with usage, which is a factor of cost and affordability, and access, which is a factor of device or lack thereof of devices. And so I think that the most important elements for us to consider is to almost scale the stairs and chew gum at the same time for most of these countries, because it's a case of you can't be left behind. You can't have your young people growing up in a space, an environment that doesn't empower and provide tech for them. But at the same time, you can't be in an environment that is either dark, so without power. So it's almost an imperative. I think it also creates that sense of urgency is helpful because it creates, it breeds creativity. The necessity of it breeds creativity so much so that as you set up your power infrastructure, you need to combine it with fiber that runs along that power line so that as you're reaching the homes, you're actually delivering a triple or dual play. So you're either landing in electricity and fiber for internet, but you could also be landing educational content. So you're landing so much more. And if you think about how we have evolved through the 90s into the new millennia and all these things, you then almost start to think and feel that we leapfrogged the whole telephone wired telephone era and just jumped and all of a sudden about 400 million Africans then got to be connected on telephone when previously you had maybe less than 5 million telephones in homes. So I think that there's a possibility there that whereas, yes, we do not have access in many ways to electricity or the electricity access is unstable. These provide opportunities for smarter devices that use solar to charge them and smarter devices that allow for homes to be wired and connected through solar powered lighting or schools to be connected through solar powered lighting. And all these opportunities then present more scope, faster speed to access. Yeah. Another question from something you said, you'd mentioned how we mustn't be distracted by the lack of access to smartphones and that there's a fair bit you can do without them with just feature phones. And you gave a very good example of mobile money, which started in your home country in Kenya with Mpesa. Can you give some other examples of applications that one can use on feature phones without having the need to have a smartphone? Because that's a very effective one that you mentioned. Yeah. So I think that there's been the power of financial services. I think DFS is one area that we've witnessed lots of access and transformation from even if you discount for mobile money, I mean, even just mobile banking, you know, where interaction between the bank and, you know, the customer issues on two factor authentication, where you can still implement security features of various applications and services using any type of phone. If you look at Ag, which is another space where applications can be accessed using USSD. And so by dialing a short code, you're able to receive either information or closes AgroVet or share information about your harvest and how much you have available for sale for the market and so on and so forth. So there's lots of innovation that is still possible to be implemented using feature phones and USSD sort of low level tech. I think I'm not saying that there's no use in place for smartphones and all that stuff. But I think the notion that you need all of these things before you get started, then means that, oh, let's just wait or let's just, let's look for $50 billion master plan to get Africa having the devices that they need to then move forward, which I think is problematic because we also discount for all these possibilities that we may be dealing with literacy levels that are still low. You're dealing with much more enhanced power needs, you're dealing with much more enhanced connectivity needs, because all the smartphones come with their own demand and drain on data. Do you then extrapolate it to cost and the cost are just way out of reach for the average person trying to balance between the  for food and maybe $3 or $4 for 1,000 MB of data. I like what you're saying, which is another way of saying, don't let great be the enemy of good. Yes. If we can do some good, do it. We can get started. I mean, if the digital financial sector focused on, oh, my God, we have to have Java-enabled funds before we do anything, then we'd never have moved the needle on access to financial services. Let's talk a little bit about African empowerment in terms of this whole DPI movement. I think you have some interesting thoughts there. Share some thoughts. Yeah, yeah. So thanks for that. I think the reality we have here is that nobody's coming to save Africa, in a sense. I think we are in a very interesting time as a continent where I think belief in self, belief in our own abilities to have answers to our problems. From mobile money's rise and rise, we can see that, okay, the continent needed solutions. We know as a continent what solutions would work for us. We know where the chute pinch is, in a sense. So my view is that we need to continuously build tech and DPI that responds to our needs. My dream is to see more and more of our young entrepreneurs, young developers building solutions for this continent with their context in mind, because someone from outside may never have the context that we are even dealing with access issues or connectivity issues. They may be building with the assumption that all that is sorted out. So take this solution or leave it. But we have an opportunity to build based on that local understanding, local wiring, local ability to say, if I have to walk to school, how can I build a solution that helps that child who's walking to school be safe as they walk to school, and also to be able to alert the village in case of danger? Such kind of solutions only come from your own understanding of the reality on the ground. And I think my hope is for the continent that we begin to have that belief in ourselves, believe that we can do it. One last question for you. As a Kenyan, Kenya has often been considered the Silicon Savannah of Africa. We've talked about what's happening in other countries. Tell us a little bit about where you see DPI in Kenya, because we know that there's a lot of development there, a lot of entrepreneurial activity, a lot of high-tech skills. Where is Kenya in all of this? Wow, wow, Teresa. I think Kenya's had good leadership on tech, but I think that's been taken for granted. I think that it's almost digressed to my mind, because there's a sense to it that because there's a sense to which talent exists, and there's great talent, but there is a gap in leadership. Remember what I talked about, the role of leadership in driving forward adoption and even skill of DPI. You need leadership. I think there is a sense to which Kenya, in the space we are in at the moment, as DPI is taking off, we are not getting the leadership in the right spaces that can then help us to navigate, can help the younger people to build solutions. I attended a very illuminating hackathon two months back, and I was quite impressed. I had become very discouraged that, oh my God, where's all this talent? Where did it go? The young people were very switched on. I was so impressed by the technology, the solution that was coming out, but then I said, there's a gap, because there can't be this many solutions that are being brought forth by these young people. I mean, it was a hackathon, and they were supposed to build something in 24, actually, no, just over 24 hours, maybe 36 hours, and they came up with some really, really solid solution. Needless to say, they were more oriented around civic engagement and all that, but I was quite impressed at their speed, at how many there were. There were, I mean, this hackathon, I mean, we didn't expect more than 50, but there was, I think, 90 enrollments that came through from the developer community, and I said, this is impressive, just needs to be harnessed. And if I cast my mind at the time when the leadership that Kenya provided on tech and all these things existed, I think there was a great sense to which political will, political leadership and ministerial levels were very much switched on. I mean, there's a change of guard now, and our hope is they probably will take a bit more forward-looking approach to harness all this talent that exists within the country for greater good. Manuel, thank you so much. You are clearly one of the continent's leaders in this space, and it's our privilege to be able to sit down and speak with you and learn about your views on DPI in Africa today. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

> So thanks, Teresa. So my name is Emmanuel Kisa, and I'm the Africa Director for the Center for
> Digital Public Infrastructure. Wonderful. Yeah. So tell us, Emmanuel, what does this center do? So
> CDPI is a pro bono tech advisory facility housed within IIITB, Bangalore. And what we help, we do
> is to help countries to design better systems and ensure that DPI is widespread across the world.
> It's a global South-South initiative, and one of the key areas where we intervene is in sitting
> with governments and supporting them to design solutions that are open, interoperable, and
> privacy-by-design. What African countries are you working with? So we currently work with about
> seven African countries. Zambia is our lead country in the continent. We also have Uganda, which is
> closing as a close second. We have Nigeria, Malawi, Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania.
> Wonderful. Yes. So I read a little bit about the work that you've done in Zambia. Tell us a little
> bit about the success there. Yes. So one of the – so Zambia was obviously the first country that we
> tried to engage when we – when the center was moving into Africa. We found an ecosystem that did
> not have electronic KYC, and we needed to support them. So they had great ambitions. And for people
> who don't know what KYC is. Okay. So Electronic Know Your Customer is a way to digitally verify the
> identity of a customer that you're engaging and that you're working with. And that's for a bank.
> And it is for a bank primarily, but in Zambia we've had an expanded use case and scope, and so we
> have one of the digital health platforms using the same electronic KYC platform. We also have the
> government's social protection fund for the drought victims, victims of the worst drought in Zambia
> in 100 years. And so that drought intervention program is utilizing this same electronic KYC to
> help with identification of beneficiaries and also disbursement of the – yeah. So I think I cut you
> off, and that's where you were going with this, explaining to our audience what the benefit of a
> more sophisticated KYC platform is, the benefit to society is. Yes. So the benefit of an e-KYC is
> that it sparks innovation. And in a digital sense, because you then are able to build solutions
> within the ecosystem, including FinTech, including InsureTech, including EdTech, solutions that
> help to deliver services faster and reliably to the community. One of the obvious financial
> benefits, for example, for the Zambia ecosystem has been the potential for this to be used for
> loans application for students who are applying for government scholarship. And so it makes it
> easier for the government to be able to provide the funding to students in universities, primarily,
> and also in Tivet colleges. Tivet has technical vocational training centers, yeah. So we're talking
> about electronic KYC, but let's back up just a little bit, because when we – you're here discussing
> digital public infrastructure, and that's one important component of it. Yes. But if we peel back
> the layer and just start at the most foundational level for DPI, a country needs to also have
> strong power and internet before you can even get there. Yes. So can you comment in Zambia, did you

I think the reality we have here is that nobody's coming to save Africa in a sense. I think we are in a very interesting time as a continent where I think belief in self, belief in our own abilities to have answers to our problems and from mobile monies rise and rise, we can see that, okay, the continent needed solution. We know as a continent what solutions would work for us. We know where the chute pinch is in a sense. So my view is that we need to continuously build tech and DPI that responds to our needs. My dream is to see more and more of our young entrepreneurs, young developers building solutions for this continent with their context in mind because someone from outside may never have the context that we are even dealing with access issues or connectivity issues. They may be building with the assumption that all that is sorted out. So take this solution or leave it. But we have an opportunity to build based on that local understanding, local wiring, you know, local ability to say, if I have to walk to school, how can I build a solution that helps that child who's walking to school, you know, be safe as they walk to school, and also to be able to alert the village in case of danger. Such kind of solutions only come from your own understanding of the reality on the ground. And I think my hope is for the continent that we begin to have that belief in ourselves, believe that we can do it. One last question for you. As a Kenyan, Kenya has often been considered the Silicon Savannah of Africa. We've talked about what's happening in other countries. Tell us a little bit about where you see DPI in Kenya because we know that there's a lot of development there, a lot of entrepreneurial activity, a lot of high-tech skills. Where is Kenya in all of this? Wow. Wow, Teresa. I think Kenya's had good leadership in tech, but I think that's been taken for granted. I think that it's almost digressed to my mind because there's a sense to which talent exists and there's great talent, but there is a gap in leadership. Remember what I talked about, the role of leadership in driving forward adoption and even scale of DPI. You need leadership. I think there is a sense to which Kenya in the space we are in at the moment, as DPI is taking off, we are not getting the leadership in the right spaces that can then help us to navigate, can help the younger people to build solutions. I attended a very illuminating hackathon two months back and I was quite impressed. I had become very discouraged that, oh my God, where's all this talent? Where did it go? The young people were very switched on. I was so impressed by the technology, the solution that was coming out, but then I said there's a gap because there can't be this many solutions that are being brought forth by these young people. I mean, it was a hackathon and they were supposed to build something in 24, actually, no, about just over 24 hours, maybe 36 hours. And they came up with some really, really solid solution. Needless to say, they were more oriented around civic engagement and all that. But I was quite impressed at their speed, at how many they were. They were, I mean, this hackathon, I mean, we didn't expect more than 50, but there was, I think, 90 enrollments that came through from the developer community. And I said, you know, this is impressive. Just needs to be harnessed. And if I cast my mind at the time when the leadership that Kenya provided on tech and all these things existed, I think there was a great sense to which political will, political leadership and ministerial levels were very much switched on. I mean, there's a change of guard now and our hope is they probably will take a bit more forward-looking approach to harness all this talent that existed in the country, you know, for greater good. Manuel, thank you so much. You are clearly one of the continent's leaders in this space and it's our privilege to be able to sit down and speak with you and learn about your views on DPI in Africa today. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> So, one of the important learning that we went through as the DPI, Digital Public Infrastructure, rollout happened in the countries is that various reasons, for various reasons because most of these projects are driven by some government departments or ministries. So obviously, the rigor of the paperwork and the transparency reasons and so on, government takes more time. But peculiarly, when it comes to Digital Public Infrastructure, which is supposed to be a set of minimal building blocks, not the full solution, on top of which other people can build. Even there, even though they are minimal and simple, in one sense, lot of us think they are simple enough, frankly. But it does take a long time, long time due to variety of reasons. Reasons such as, you know, who is going to help me as if I am a department, who is going to put together the first set of documents to kick start the project. So I need a consultant or I need somebody, but how do I choose a consultant? Then I need an RFP to choose a consultant. So I already spent two, three months to choose a consultant or a partner. When one starts the project, then projects, you have to define the entire requirements and the, you know, contractual obligations around it in the form of an RFP to actually build the DPI. So, it is like saying, oh, I want to build my house. Obviously, I have to make up my mind of everything in the house, design the whole house, everything, then outsource it to someone to build it. Now, this custom way of doing it has two problems. One, you have to know upfront what you want to build. So you take a long time to figure out what do you actually want, what do you want to build, then use a mechanism to write all that down into an RFP process. So typically preparation of this RFP itself and requirements, contractual obligations, SLAs and the functional requirements, technology requirements, scale and security requirements all have to be spelt out in a government RFP and they will spell it out, it takes months. Then you put out an RFP, then you hope that you have competitive bids coming from the, you know, ecosystem. The problem with that is by the time you get through this funnel of figuring out, you selecting a vendor, it already probably at least nine months, six to nine months, maybe even 12 months. So when you select that, you remember, you have not even began writing anything or building no house yet, nothing has been built yet, not even the first brick has been laid yet. You are in the process of that, you already spent nine months. Now you are saying, okay, now I have to onboard the new vendor, system integrator or somebody who I selected, they start building the house, building the DPI. And the build typically, because everything is custom, the build takes slightly longer because they tried building everything. When you build something, you have to test it out, you have to do security testing, functional testing, acceptance, payment of the vendor appropriately. And that cycle, what's called a build test, get ready cycle is also another minimum. No software vendor is going to say, I'll build it for one week. It is going to be typically because system integrators take time, they do say everything is in months. So another six, nine months, so by the time you are already one and a half years, by the time you get to some form of rollout, then you test it out production ready rollout, right, that is what you do. So typical cycle of what we call a 24 month, you know, cycle that goes on. Question we were asking is this, how can we compress this? Because every leader in a country wants it faster. Bureaucrats who are running, who are in charge of the business, wants it faster. It's not their interest to get stuck in a technology build cycle with no outcome at the end of the tunnel. So it's important that we compress the cycle because leadership in the countries want faster rollout of DPIs and compressed timelines. Interestingly, citizens also want it because they're also been waiting. So you see this tremendous friction between the speed and agility wanting to do that fast versus the traditional IT procurement, large project overhead that is always there for a large DPI. So as part of many conversations with countries, this idea evolved over the last few months, the idea called DAS. And DAS stands for DPI as a package solution. Package solution is a real keyword is that can we reimagine at least the popular DPIs, not all DPIs, like identity, credentialing, data, payment, you know, things that everybody talks about, registries and many other pieces of this puzzle that now most world over people have understood that being the most common, what's called a foundational set of building blocks. These foundational DPIs, there is no reason, frankly, to rebuild them from scratch. Much of that is available in digital public goods as open source projects. So the real question we were asking is can we take those projects? Can we package the DPI? DPI, not only software, technology packaging, policy packaging, project plan packaging, fund packaging, can we package everything as much as possible? Now we know obviously you can't package it 100% but package it so that the contextualization into a country's, you know, the mapping between the package and the actual country deployment is from two year cycle, which we talked about. We can compress it to three to six months. And finally, we actually believe it's totally possible, very, very, very possible for us to, if we put all our heads together, we should be able to very clearly take the common set of foundational DPGs, package them fully, including policy templates, project plan templates, training, capacity building, ecosystem readiness. If we can package that well, there is no reason why countries should go through an elongated high risk two year, three year cycles for DPI deployment. So DAS provides a brilliant way to bridge the gap between the agility and the speed of the leaders that leaders want to see to open source way of fast tracking this DPI implementation through DPGs, package DPGs. So the DAS is the name that actually brings this idea forward. And it can be cloud native, cloud ready, private cloud, public cloud, it doesn't matter where you deploy, but it's one click deployable. Think of that very fast deployable, rapid piloting and rapid policy shift, then allow the countries to continue to own their IP, their data, their management control. There is no lack of any of that, but except that we are just compressing the two year time.

**Video Transcript:**
> What is Digital Public Infrastructure? Imagine a 3 year old girl going to school for the first time. It takes 15 years for that little girl to be transformed into a confident teenager, by the time she is complete with her school education. That 15 years is a complex set of actors, parents, teachers, administrators, content creators, academicians, community, technologists, whole lot of people come together, the classmates of that girl, all of them come together to make it an education journey for that 3 year old to become an 18 year old. In a country like that, we have 260 million such children, learning in 22 languages, across 60 boards of education, each autonomous, taught in 1.4 million schools, taught by 9.5 million teachers. When you are faced with something as large, as diverse, as complex as this, the question we asked as X-Step Foundation, when we were set up in 2015, was what is the role technology can play in solving for education outcomes? That thinking led us to the DPI approach, and some of us were anyway, part of the Aadhaar startup journey, under the leadership of Nanda Nilekani, who is also my co-founder at X-Step Foundation with Rohini Nilekani. So we knew how DPIs work. The question was, how could we use DPIs in education? And if you think about it, the 3 key constructs of DPI, which is a strong digital backbone or infrastructure, appropriate policies, and innovation by the ecosystem, are even more relevant in education. And that is how we conceived of a digital infrastructure for education. In fact, it is called DIGSHA, which is Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing, X-Step Foundation co-created it with the Government of India and many other players. It was launched in around December 2017 as offering access to local content. So what it did was, when the Government of India offered this as an infrastructure to all those 60 boards, each board could create their own digital content and link it to the existing textbooks. What this did was, it allowed children to access digital content relevant to them, relevant to the topic they are learning, through the mechanism of unique QR codes in the textbook. So as a result, 600 million plus textbooks all over India became QR coded and connected to digital content, each created by their respective boards. And as part of implementing the national education policy, where digital infrastructure is a crucial component of technology. What this did was, over 17, 18, 19, and before the pandemic of 2020, there was a mass scale adoption. More than 30 states and union territories out of India's 36, came on board this digital infrastructure offered by the Government of India. So DIGSHA was a Government of India infrastructure, X-Step and some of the other not-for-profits came together and co-created this. This infrastructure, on which the various other boards innovated on, in their own language, with their own content, and in line with the broad policy architecture of the national education policy 2020, is again a very good example of digital public infrastructure in education. But what is DPI? It is that which offers a specific service at population scale, so that others don't have to create that service. Because the Government of India provided this national infrastructure as a service, the various boards could now use that service to link their existing physical content in textbooks, in their language, with their curriculum, to the relevant digital content. Innovation on top. And all in line with existing policies. So this was the first major use case of DPI, and an example of innovation by the ecosystem on top. The second example of why DIGSHA is a good DPI is it is evolvable. And I'll give you two examples of that. During pandemic, when schools shut down, teacher training also shut down. Learning by children continued, because those textbooks were already QR coded, and children could access that digital content sitting at home. But how do teachers come together and train? So very quickly, another service was added on DIGSHA, which is teacher training. And because DIGSHA was designed as a DPI, and using the building blocks, very rapidly, a teacher training building block was added. As a result, over the next two, three years, 22,000 courses have been created by the ecosystem. And close to 140 million teacher credentials have been issued. Around 7 million teachers undergoing these courses and getting the 140 million credentials. Another part of a good DPI is inclusive innovation. In DIGSHA, it did not matter what kind of a device you had, whether it was a mobile phone, a laptop, a tablet. And if a child did not have access to a digital device, the teachers, and most teachers in India have a device, the teachers could showcase that content in class, either through televisions, like in certain states, or in some cases, through their own personal mobile phones, which has happened in other states. So thinking of inclusive innovation while creating a DPI was a necessity for a country as large and diverse as India. But that's not enough of a DPI, because no DPI is born perfect and fully complete. A good DPI can and must keep evolving. So when the generative AI disruption hit us all in 2022, there was a great opportunity for DIGSHA to leverage that and add a generative AI component into DIGSHA. So very quickly, another service was added, wherein a combination of generative AI on Indian languages and using open source digital building blocks came together to create a series of bots for teachers, for parents, where they could access relevant information about how to teach better for teachers, about how to handle children, young children at home for parents. And these answers are in the local language of the teacher or the parent. And they refer to official documents, which are mostly in English or Hindi, so that the answers are authoritative and also relevant to the question. So this is a good example of the evolvability of a DPI and how DIGSHA was designed for evolvability. The other aspect of a DPI is, does it allow the ecosystem to work better together? As I explained, education is a complex ecosystem. There are so many people working together. A good DPI should be able to help them work better. And a way to do that is through responsible data sharing, data on usage of content, data on credentialing, which teachers have got which credentials on completing courses. And DIGSHA was designed for sharing of data responsibly within the system by those who needed that data. It could be data about course completion, data about which content in which language of which subject was being used more, so that the authorities can take better decisions on the back of that. In the case of DIGSHA, what was different was, it was built on a set of open source code that AXSTEP put together, what we call as digital public goods. In this case, it is Sunbird. What a well-designed digital public good does for DPIs is it allows the creation of multiple DPIs. So while DIGSHA was created using Sunbird, another learning platform called IGOT was also created. This one by the Department of Personal and Training and specifically for training government employees. Two different DPIs built of the same digital public good. Why is this important? When other countries want to create their own DPI in education, they don't need to start from scratch. They can take openly available, free to use public good like Sunbird and create their own DIGSHA. And there's a lot of interest and a lot of efforts going on to take Sunbird by other countries and build their own learning platforms, their own DPIs on top. And that brings me back to a central concept that can differentiate a great DPI from a good DPI, which is the idea of open innovation. In education in particular, we have seen islands of excellence. We have seen silos of innovation. Innovation happens in a particular area by a particular group, but that cannot flow or diffuse to the larger ecosystem. So open innovation is an idea that is particularly relevant in education where I can take someone's innovation and build on top. In the case of the generative AI example I gave, DIGSHA took generative AI technology, took AI for Bharat, open DPIs for language translation and added a new module on DIGSHA. This also means that other countries can take certain parts of Sunbird, combine it with other technologies and create their own unique DPIs. And open innovation, I believe, is a way to maximize the full power of DPIs. But like with anything at XSTEP, we believe all solutions have to be people plus technology. And in edtech, there is a danger of starting with technology and not with people, the learners, the teachers, the parents and the use cases. So to conclude, our learning has been start with where a system is. What are the current problems it is facing? What can be transformed through a combination of a digital infrastructure, innovation on top, in line with existing policies? And then work with the large existing ecosystem in your countries and avoid the pitfall of just looking at what is not there. Look at what you already have. In India, we had a lot of textbooks. In India, we knew teachers had cell phones. A lot of schools had basic infrastructure. Building on what is abundant to create your own DPI is very important. And resisting the urge to copy another DPI because it worked well. It's a fascinating journey. In India, we are still on the journey. But I would be very happy to learn from your experiences and share our experiences in more detail for those interested. Thank you.

> did was when the Government of India offered this as an infrastructure to all those 60 boards, each

> was it allowed children to access digital content relevant to them, relevant to the topic they are
> learning through the mechanism of unique QR codes in the textbook. So as a result, 600 million plus
> textbooks all over India became QR coded and connected to digital content, each created by their
> respective boards and as part of implementing the national education policy, where digital
> infrastructure is a crucial component of technology. What this did was over 17, 18, 19 and before
> the pandemic of 2020, there was a mass scale adoption. More than 30 states and union territories
> out of India's 36 came on board this digital infrastructure offered by the Government of India. So
> DIGSHA was a Government of India infrastructure, AXSTEP and some of the other not-for-profits came
> together and co-created this. This infrastructure on which the various other boards innovated on in
> their own language with their own content and in line with the broad policy architecture of the
> National Education Policy 2020 is again a very good example of digital public infrastructure in
> education. But what is DPI? It is that which offers a specific service at population scale so that
> others don't have to create that service. Because the Government of India provided this national
> infrastructure as a service, the various boards could now use that service to link their existing
> physical content in textbooks in their language with their curriculum to the relevant digital
> content, innovation on top and all in line with existing policies. So this was the first major use
> case of DPI and an example of innovation by the ecosystem on top. The second example of why DIGSHA
> is a good DPI is it is evolvable and I'll give you two examples of that. During pandemic, when
> school shut down, teacher training also shut down, learning by children continued because those
> textbooks were already QR coded and children could access that digital content sitting at home. But
> how do teachers come together and train? So very quickly another service was added on DIGSHA which
> is teacher training and because DIGSHA was designed as a DPI and using the building blocks, very
> rapidly a teacher training building block was added. As a result, over the next 2-3 years, 22,000
> courses have been created by the ecosystem and close to 140 million teacher credentials have been
> issued, around 7 million teachers undergoing these courses and getting the 140 million credentials.
> Another part of a good DPI is inclusive innovation. In DIGSHA, it did not matter what kind of a
> device you had, whether it was a mobile phone, a laptop, a tablet and if a child did not have
> access to a digital device, the teachers and most teachers in India have a device, the teachers
> could showcase that content in class either through televisions like in certain states or in some
> cases through their own personal mobile phones which has happened in other states. So thinking of
> inclusive innovation while creating a DPI was a necessity for a country as large and diverse as
> India. But that's not enough of a DPI because no DPI is born perfect and fully complete. A good DPI
> can and must keep evolving. So when the generative AI disruption hit us all in 2022, there was a
> great opportunity for DIGSHA to leverage that and add a generative AI component into DIGSHA. So
> very quickly, another service was added wherein a combination of generative AI on Indian languages
> and using open source digital building blocks came together to create a series of bots for
> teachers, for parents where they could access relevant information about how to teach better for
> teachers, about how to handle children, young children at home for parents and these answers are in
> the local language of the teacher or the parent and they refer to official documents which are
> mostly in English or Hindi so that the answers are authoritative and also relevant to the question.
> So this is a good example of the evolvability of a DPI and how DIGSHA was designed for
> evolvability. The other aspect of a DPI is does it allow the ecosystem to work better together. As
> I explained, education is a complex ecosystem, there are so many people working together. A good
> DPI should be able to help them work better and a way to do that is through responsible data
> sharing, data on usage of content, data on credentialing, which teachers have got which credentials
> on completing courses and DIGSHA was designed for sharing of data responsibly within the system by
> those who needed the data. It could be data about course completion, data about which content in
> which language of which subject was being used more so that the authorities can take better
> decisions on the back of that. In the case of DIGSHA, what was different was it was built on a set
> of open source code that AXSTEP put together what we call as digital public goods. In this case, it
> is Sunbird. What a well-designed digital public good does for DPIs is it allows the creation of
> multiple DPIs. So, while DIGSHA was created using Sunbird, another learning platform called IGOT
> was also created. This one by the Department of Personnel and Training and specifically for
> training government employees. Two different DPIs built of the same digital public good. Why is
> this important? When other countries want to create their own DPI in education, they do not need to
> start from scratch. They can take openly available free to use public good like Sunbird and create
> their own DIGSHA and there is a lot of interest and a lot of efforts going on to take Sunbird by
> other countries and build their own learning platforms, their own DPIs on top and that brings me
> back to a central concept that can differentiate a great DPI from a good DPI which is the idea of
> open innovation. In education in particular, we have seen islands of excellence. We have seen silos
> of innovation. Innovation happens in a particular area by a particular group but that cannot flow
> or diffuse to the larger ecosystem. So, open innovation is an idea that is particularly relevant in
> education where I can take someone's innovation and build on top. In the case of the generative AI
> example I gave, DIGSHA took generative AI technology, took AI for Bharat, open DPIs for language
> translation and added a new module on DIGSHA. This also means that other countries can take certain
> parts of Sunbird, combine it with other technologies and create their own unique DPIs and open
> innovation I believe is a way to maximize the full power of DPIs but like with anything at XSTEP,
> we believe all solutions have to be people plus technology and in edtech, there is a danger of
> starting with technology and not with people, the learners, the teachers, the parents and the use
> cases. So, to conclude, our learning has been start with where a system is, what are the current
> problems it is facing, what can be transformed through a combination of a digital infrastructure,

**Video Transcript:**
> Can I please bring on Kamiya Chandra, the Chief Strategy Officer at the Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure, who's been doing better, cheaper, faster. Kamiya, tell us how. Can you guys hear me clearly? So I think Pramod has told you kind of what the next six years, five to six years should look like. I want to talk you through what you can do in six weeks if you're working in a country. Because I think we have to span both of those horizons. We have to think six years, ten years ahead, and we have to think what can we get done to affect millions of lives in the next six weeks. So I'm Kamiya, I'm from the Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure, which Pramod is the co-chair of, and we sort of provide pro bono technology architecture advice. But this idea of DAS or DPI as a package solution, this thinking about how do we drive rapid deployment is actually not a CDPI effort. You see all of these logos, I think most of the logos on that screen, plus the ones on the top, have all come together in sort of an ecosystem approach, because DPIs are about ecosystems. They're not ever about just one logo. So what have we seen in countries? We've seen that the path to DPI implementation is full of potholes, right? You have issues around timelines, because of the timeline of procurement, the timeline to get funding approval, which I'm sure will be discussed in the breakout room. You have technology vendor issues and concerns, corrections, calibrations, change requests, famously, across the sector. You have hiring, you have capacity issues. All of these are major challenges that are preventing countries from saying, hey, this is a great idea. This is a great concept. We know it's been done before in so many countries around the world, from Brazil to Estonia to Singapore to India to Thailand and beyond. How do we get something like this for the baseline identities, payments, data sharing, that can actually get deployed in a short period of time? So the intent to implement is no longer in question. There's at least 35 countries that we're talking to personally, and between the World Bank with 50-plus active projects, UNDP with 40, 50 countries' active projects, it's very clear that the countries have intent. The question is now, how do we get to rapid, right? In order to get to rapid, we want you to think of two separate pieces. Let's see if we can separate the problem out. There's one side of the problem, which is sort of a greenfield implementation. You're starting from scratch, multimillion-dollar project. You have to enroll maybe 50 million people into a new system. You have to start a new payment system completely from scratch. Let's put those aside, because counterintuitively, most countries are not starting from scratch. Most countries already have digital assets that they actually can just build on. They already have some ID system that's functioning in the country. They have some payments infrastructure. They have some paper certificates as a method of data sharing, or even digital certificates, PDFs, that they're using to generate land records, or they're using to give you your social benefits, or they're using to register marriages and licenses, right, of all kinds. Our question is, if we focus on that right side, can we rapidly upgrade an existing digital infrastructure? Let's say you have an ID system. Let's add a digital authentication mechanism, a digital mechanism to share those profile data fields to anyone else in the ecosystem who can reuse it. Let's start with a digital credential or certificate that Pramod talked about and add a digitally signed QR code on it, so that paper that's so easy to travel across borders with becomes a digital public infrastructure for the person and a mechanism of data sharing. Can we unlock these kinds of rapid deployments? And our thinking here is that this rapid upgrade section, these can be prepackaged very well in order to avoid these risks, right? The risks of security issues, privacy vulnerabilities, the risks of vendor lock-in and vendor challenges, the risks of technology architecture errors in framing it, in order to minimize those risks and to drive speed and scale across the 50-plus countries that want to implement this in a rapid time, we think the prepackaging is key. Now, what do we mean when we say prepackaging? First is the technology part. What does that mean? It just means reusable code, right? It can be open source code. It can be even code share on a bilateral arrangement from one entity to another. But the code doesn't have to be recreated from scratch. It also means you can leverage, if you choose, public or private clouds, right? So hyperscalers in the room can be used for hosted solutions, but that's not mandated. You can also host it on premises if you have your own servers or if you have some form of private cloud. All three, when your technology hardware infrastructure is ready and the code is reusable, your tech can be prepackaged to minimize mistakes and errors. But the technology providers who have these packages can't scale themselves to 50 or 100 countries to the demand, because that's just too large an ask of them. So how do we get them to move faster? The next step is teams. They have to train private service provider teams to say, actually, this is how you deploy my package, right? So with an ecosystem of pre-trained private service providers, many of whom are in this room and have gone through the training, by the way, you can actually choose your army as a country, right? You can say I don't just want this prepackaged technology. I want a program team. I want that team to know how to deploy the specific building block in the DPI approach. It's been certified as a trained service provider on the prepackaged technology. But that team sometimes has to also be made sure that they're enabled with the right building block so that they don't make mistakes either, right? And for that, we created a bunch of standard artifacts, a standard playbook to, again, minimize the scope for mistakes to increase speed and to drive scale. This includes a standardized scope documentation, standardized framing of how big the team should be and what capacity role job titles should be on the team. It includes thinking around what the governance on the team should be. Who's in the steering committee? Who's in the program committee? How often should the program team meet versus the steering committee meet? A short policy paper template, a standard costing model. These kinds of artifacts are the things that allow those pre-trained teams to actually succeed. Fourth, the governance arrangements between all of the teams that interact with each other. Legal partnerships cannot be underestimated. So for this, we've put together sort of shared ecosystem participation terms that say all of the service providers in this ecosystem commit to these guidelines on cybersecurity, on individual privacy, on protecting the country's interests, on contributing back to the open source code in case there are changes that are made and so on to prevent technology risks from taking off. It also includes standardized bilateral agreements between a country and a technology provider, between the technology open reusable code provider and a private service provider and so on. So we minimize the time for the lawyers to get in the room and spend their weeks, right, and earn their share in that sense. And finally, funding. This is the piece of the puzzle where we're aiming for two weeks for a country approval. Our thinking is if you've gone through all of the four stages before that, we have prepackaged the tech, prepackaged the process, reduced the risks, as well as templatized the implementation, the funding approval doesn't have to be as long as it is per country, right? You do it at an international level, at a program level, and you say, all right, this country wants to deploy this standard product. This is not rocket science to me anymore. So you can fast track it. And thankfully, we've sort of with co-developed support raised about 
**Video Transcript:**
> (Failed to download audio for transcription) million to start with for the first two, and we're hoping to raise more for the additional round of countries that are coming in. I think this sounds like a lot. It sounds like a unicorn pipe dream, right? But this work has been going on for the last eight months. The Carnegie Summit in December, the Global Technology Summit was where the paper between Rahul, Rudra, Prabodh, and Madhukar co-authored was released on DAS. And following that, a bunch of those artifacts that I showed you in this slide have actually been put together in their first draft. They're all available to comment on in public. There's already been four private service providers that have been trained. Actually, raise your hand if you're in the room. I know Anisin is here. You guys have been trained there, I see. So there's a bunch of folks in the room as well who's already been trained in terms of the cloud providers as well who have come on. I saw Rohini here earlier, other partners from GCP and others excited about the opportunity to offer this as a choice. And the reason that all of these logos, again, are important is because we don't think that any one institution or any one mechanism can actually scale to support all of the countries in this ecosystem without working with others in the group. We think the Big Tent approach is really the only way where we're going to get collaboration and good kinds of competition in place between private service providers in partnership with funding and other kinds of support. The final point I'll make is that country work has already begun. Brazil, who I think is in the room, Trinidad and Tobago have already started on this journey and are aiming to go live before the year ends. And there's countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America that are focusing on the design. So the last thing I'll leave you with is if you'd like to co-create on this with us, please scan that QR code to get to that 50-plus countries, 500 million people, really able to reuse something in their life and see this change within the year, right? And not just as something on a PowerPoint slide. But thank you so much. Thank you.

   7. What is Digital Public Infrastructure?

**Video Transcript:**
> You've definitely heard of Digital Public Infrastructure, or DPI, but can you explain what it really is? Let's take a look at it through the eyes of billions of people at the risk of being left behind. Meet Amari. Amari needs to prove she owns her land, pay for government fees, and receive payments for various services. She needs to provide the Ministry of Lands a copy of her ID card, an authorization from her bank, and half a dozen other documents. Just imagine how much time she would save if she could access these documents with just a few clicks. The Ministry could then also quickly make sure her documents are authentic. For this to happen, identity, credentials, and payment services must be digitized and connected with each other, both across ministries and private data providers like banks. This is exactly what DPI is all about. By digitizing more public and private services on common infrastructure, we will create more value for each of us. To actually make Amari's life easier, some rules must be respected. Think of a railway system, with stations, tracks, and trains. Whatever the length of the train, the wheel spacing must be identical. Whatever route it takes, the signaling must be consistent. And whatever the train's schedule, time must be measured uniformly across stations. This guarantees the smooth functioning of the infrastructure and ensures scale-up from network effects by breaking down silos. The result? Travelers get to their destinations safely and comfortably. With built-in open standards that are reusable, not only does it become easier for Amari to access information and payments, but this infrastructure can connect everyone, everywhere, to other opportunities and services. With privacy embedded up front in the design, people can rest assured that their data will be kept safe and secure. The world over, countries are starting to build their own digital railways. The good news is they can pick among the best existing practices and adapt them to the tastes and travel habits of their people. The tracks we lay today will shape the infrastructure we will share tomorrow. So, let's join forces and shape this new infrastructure towards ensuring that DPI is safe, accessible, green, financed, and future-ready. For more UN videos visit www.un.org

**Video Transcript:**
> I hope that everyone is having a great time at day one at MOSIP Connect. We had such amazing sessions, interactive sessions. So now we have session on exploring emerging opportunities, go-to-market strategy. Dr. Pramod Verma, Center for DPI, along with Mr. Sashi Kumar Ganesan, Head of Engineering MOSIP, will have a small fireside chat to explore the opportunities. Sashi, I would like to call you on the stage. This is going to be an exciting chat. I and Pramod worked for a very long time, but never a conversation like this. We have to go closer, I think. Okay. I don't think we ever sat like this and chatted. No, no, no. I think most of it has been tech and security discussions, and this is going to be a little of a larger one. So definitely this is an exciting time. So a quick introduction to people who don't know Pramod. Pramod is the Chief Architect of Aadhaar, which is India's national ID, which is shown 1.2 billion. If I'm not wrong, that's 1.39 billion IDs, and it's the largest biometric identity system in the world. He has also been the architect of DigiLocker and the UPI, which is the largest payment in the world, again. In the world, again. And he has been behind quite a lot of DPIs that's happening around the world today. So excited to have you, Pramod, here. It's fantastic to be back. Nothing like coming from airport straight to the panel. Your energy is amazing, Pramod. It just brings us back to those 50 years before discussions. Okay. So I'll start from the basics, Pramod. This DPI story has been a very exciting time. I think we want to start with why do we need DPI for countries? And it seems to be more advocated for countries rather than generally DPI, right? We would like to understand what you think. Yeah, I think the digitization has been going on for a while. Everybody knows we have been digitizing since the 90s, mostly, most of the digitization efforts. But I think in the last decade or so, not just India, several countries started experimenting on the idea that you can create a digital reusable building block. Reuse. Reuse is the key. Really. And identity. I mean, that's what you guys do. So identity was almost always the reusable, obvious reusable element, because ID spans every system, and payments span every system. So I think most countries looked at ID and payment almost in the last decade. But I think the last year, during the G20, I think the common vocabulary, common terminology was defined, and the word digital public or the phrase digital public infrastructure was coined under the G20 discussions to just call what many of you have been already doing, right? To say, if you are building digital reusable building blocks that can be reused by both public and private systems, you have a DPR. Why is it key? It's, for us, it's very, very straightforward. Many, many software, notoriously, we are all part of it, okay? When software, when you build software, you, it's easy to build software in one sense and easy to, you know, sort of do it your way. So it's like saying, imagine, in physical infrastructure, you guys, you decide, I need my own road. And somebody says, no, no, no, no, I'll build my own road. It doesn't happen because it is just very tough. And it's expensive. But in software, it's not tough to screw it up. Okay, it's quite easy to screw it up, actually. So what we have been traditionally doing is that you put out a project and I want to build the whole thing. It's also to do with the mindset that why should I be dependent on another department or another player in the system? So many reasons. People tend to build the whole thing again and again and again. You know, it makes no sense. It makes no sense because it's just ridiculous to redo that. Especially when you're using taxpayers' money. It makes no sense. So I think the idea of DPI is that there are many pieces of that puzzle that can be created as reusable elements in a digital society. If you can extract those and create a reusable building block and element, you are doing DPI. Very high chance many of you are already doing DPI. So that's an interesting definition about the comparison of multiple roads and software. I would say in a construction of a road or any physical tangible items, you know what a success is. Now, you define something, a new term, DPI, at least existence for the last three, four years. Now, how do you define this success? Because a completion of a road is a successful one. You know what it is. You've done and you've completed and the work exists for everybody to see and use. What do you think is a success of a DPI? Let's stick with the same example. Is building the road success enough or using the road success enough? It depends on who gets the payment, I think so. Yeah. You get the payment, not to build the road. I agree. Yeah, so from a builder perspective, you're right. Many people would say, just issue the ID or just build the road. I'm done with my part and hence I can call myself success. But real success, I mean, if you take a step back, real success of a DPI is really twofold. Exactly twofold. One, it has the use of the DPI, usage of the DPI, usage of the road, usage of the ID, usage of the payment. Usage has unblocked or unlocked significant societal value for citizens. It has unlocked value. That means people say, my God, I love the fact that this highway has come. It has reduced my time. It's easier for me. You know, my school is closer. Whatever it is, it has unlocked value. Point number one. Point number two, it also must unlock a private and public and private innovation ecosystem. Because otherwise it's not sustainable. To sustain any such infrastructure, you must create that domino effect to trigger an ecosystem of public and private players who can build on top of that road or on top of that DPI. If we can build applications, innovations, new forms of vehicles, new way of driving, whatever it is you want to innovate. If you can build innovation, both public and private innovation, with these two, you can call yourself DPI successful. If you look back to ask this question to yourself, is your DPI being used every day by people? That's number one. Question number two, are there private and public ecosystem, other departments, other private entities who are actually building applications and they become the spokesmen for your DPI? Then you have it. That's your success. Okay. That's a good definition to have and I think that would help our audience and countries to define that. In fact, it's easier to define. Now it looks like... It's hard though. Because one of the issues, it's easier to define. But most people shy away from defining usage metrics. Because, you know, I am an ID issuing department. My job is to issue ID. Usage... How? I don't even have authority. I don't have control. I don't have any mechanism to ensure its usage by somebody else. So it's a little bit hard. So people tend to shy away. But I think India's definitely difference was that I think our DPI builders publicly announced usage metrics. Publicly. Said we will have 1 billion payments a day. Like crazy numbers. It's sort of... You need some leadership. If the leadership is bold enough, you can. And that completely flips the game. Okay. That's great. So the next interesting question that keeps coming across. What do you think is the biggest top three, four challenges that you think in adapting DPI? Because while we have been speaking about it for the last five years, India has been doing for ten years, a decade or more. And still the adoption is lower than what you would have envisaged. Right? And what do you think is the top challenges that's preventing people from taking in this path? Yeah. That's another little bit tricky issue about DPI. DPI is like your physical infrastructure. It is a digital infrastructure. What is the meaning of infrastructure? Any infrastructure investments, by the time you start seeing the ROI and start seeing the real usage, it takes time. And at least from India's experience, we normally see roughly about two years when it kicks in, into the early gear. About five years when it becomes the talk of the town. And about eight years by the time it becomes 70, 80 percentage of sort of take it for granted. Time of decade. That's long. It's long for politicians. It's long for bureaucrats. It's ten years long. Nobody plans ten years. So you have to break it down. Break down your success metrics into quantum of 12 to 18 months or 24 months. Max 24 months. Ideally 12 to 18 months. You have to define those milestones. And you have to make sure you celebrate those milestones. Celebration is part of establishing in the society. Okay. This is very important. But the real challenges are this. DPI is a long game. It is an infrastructure game. It's a long game. So you need to have patience capital. You need leadership to support you to say, yes, I know eventually by the time you get to it, it's going to be eight years. DPI started in 2014, designed 2015, pilot 2024. It's almost eight years, right? Ten years by the time we designed. Others 15 years. Identity system. So time flies by. It's crazy by the time it takes time. But you can define intermediary metrics and celebrate. You need leadership. So political support is a big challenge. And you need to garner the political support for you as a bureaucrat if you're running the system. You absolutely need. You definitely need early adopters. The real success comes from usage. I told you, right? The usage does not come from, usage almost always do not come from incumbents. That means you don't go after. When you lay a payment rail, you don't go after the largest bank. When you, you know, largest social protection. When we started our social protection transformation, what's called direct benefits transfer, G2P, we did not go after the largest two. In fact, largest two is still not DBT in India. 15 years later, we still have not fully DBTized. I mean, not fully G2P, right? Because it takes, that's tough. Because it can completely shake up a political landscape if it fails. So people don't take bet on largest one. So you look for medium-sized programs or medium-sized players in the system. Young banks or early departments to actually come in and support you. We started with a very small program on G2P, for example. Scholarship, which was very easy. Pension was very easy for us because they were starting to get digital anyway. So it was easier to go there. That's a big challenge. So crafting the adoption, who will be your biggest partner, is a challenge. Make sure that is very carefully navigated. Third, killer use cases. How do you unlock value for citizens? What would you do to make sure in three to four years, not ten years, in three to four years, a large enough population in this country is praising it and raving about it. Oh, this is awesome. Love it. Then politicians are raving about it. They take the success for it. And you're starting to get this escape velocity, right? You need that. You need to make sure that you look for a killer use case. Let's call it killer use cases. So that's third. And the fourth one, of course, you have to worry about civil society, negative implications of anything you roll out. And if you don't carefully analyze who will get hurt with your DPI, somebody is going to get hurt, right? Because you are transforming. You are re-engineering a society. And someone is either information asymmetry, middlemen, somebody is enjoying the status quo. So please make sure that analysis is happening. They will be the first one to attack you, right? So like Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi said, first two years, no one actually cares. They just leave you alone. So you have a real good window in the first two years to get something going. Then everybody wakes up to attack you, right? And then finally they sort of come along. I think that's what we went through, every one of them. Now forget identity system. Some obvious ones like payment also went through the same thing. We were killed, literally. Our UPI payment system would have been dead twice in the last eight years. Thankfully we didn't die. Yeah. So challenges are plenty. That's a helpful insight. I think in one sense, most of us are going through the same phase. We are five years down the line now. And there's big adoptions being spoken. And now critics are waking up. Yeah. We see a lot more critics than we used to. But unlock value for citizens and ecosystems. They will be the biggest spokesperson. Issuance, ID issuance, building is not enough. Supply side is not enough. Demand has to be unlocked. Unlocked. Interesting. And now that we spoke about demand and how do we actually do this. This looks like a very, very long running time and long running advice kind of a thing is needed for the government to really do this. And I also hear that you're now heading the CDPI, which is the other DPI hosted out of IITB. How are you positioning this? How are you actually envisaging this is going to help the countries? What's your leading thought process behind the CDPI? Yeah. So I think the CDPI stands for Center for Digital Public Infrastructure. It's an academic center within IIT Bangalore where MOSIP is also hosted. We are a global team. Our team is here. Many of them are here. We have folks in Africa. We have folks in LATAM. It's completely pro bono. It's done as a philanthropy initiative, philanthropic funded initiative. Why? Why did we do that? One gap we saw is the gap of design. And I recently spoke to a set of design graduates who would say, while you can argue execution is everything, if you get the design wrong, no use executing to death because you are executing a wrong plan. Right? So it is important to get design right. And DPI is by design. Infrastructure, by the nature of it, almost always starts to become national critical infrastructure. Payment and identity, credentialing, or data infrastructure. You might have the significant thought process that needs to go behind to make sure you have sovereign control. You know, you are sort of shaping your destiny yourself. And you are creating evolvability and future-proofing, incentive alignment, ecosystem incentive alignment. Someone has to think through this really well. So that you don't have the cost overruns, vendor lock-ins, and project failures, and those kind of things, right? And we went through many of this in our experience. We thought, what if we create this center for offering this architecture and design support while the countries begin, or in the way of their DPI journey. Countries reach out, just like Zoom calls sometimes, and say, let's talk to you. No formality is needed. They just talk to us. But sometimes they send us the design document. Their internal design document says, we are thinking about this way, G2P architecture. Can you just look at it? Just because you've seen so many different architecture patterns, can you see some and give us input? Yeah, sure. All that things work. Some of the countries actually go into a letter of intent or an MOU kind of relationship with CDPI, because they have a slightly long-term relationship. And some countries, we have about four countries, I think, we will end up doing actual hand-holding the pilot effort as well. But CDPI offers no software. We offer no solution. We offer nothing to do with India per se. We are simply here to look at your design and give you inputs. Because we have been there, we have done it, and we know exactly the kind of traps you fall into getting the design. Like a few lines can shift the design to getting it right and getting it wrong. It's very little. That shift is very little difference. So we are just here to support. And people ask, you know, how are you raising funds and sustaining? We have raised from the philanthropic fund. And the real, real objective is that we cease to exist in five years. Okay. That's great. We shouldn't be there. You guys should be doing it. So naturally, we have enough DPI fellows who are DPI trained folks naturally starting to think. You give a problem, they unbundle, they think like that, and they say incentives, what will right? I know they have a method to that madness. And we happily continue to do whatever we want to do in life. That's a great thing that you're thinking five years, but your actual DPI story is like ten years. But they don't need us. That's the whole idea. If everybody needs us, we have a problem. Absolutely brilliant. I love that idea of shutting down in five years and telling people, hey, you're intelligent enough to run it, don't worry. I think that builds a confidence to a lot of people out here. This may be tangent, I'm not very sure whether it's a tangent to CDPI or another one. Recently I read about your paper, I think it came out two weeks before, about the story of DAS. You're trying to package something around. I know you're packaging the CDPI as an advisory solution, or a design solution, think box. Now, what's this DAS story? What are you trying to do around that? We put out a, we have been talking to many of you, by the way, and constantly getting this feedback that countries are ready to do it, we have the intent, we are ready, but just the fact that they have to go through the motion of deciding who is going to be my partner in crime in a country to write, typically a consulting firm. To decide that consulting firm, I have to put out an RFP, then choose the consulting firm, then consulting firm helps me decide what I should be building, the DPI. And unfortunately, even in India, right, government procurement rules are very sort of tight. What does it mean? These contracts are five year to eight years. That means you as a DPI owner has to now decide in the next three months or five months, as you write your RFP, everything you want to build ever in the next eight years. And remember, Chad GP didn't exist a year and a half ago. So the speed at which things change, and the government contracting nature are in conflict. They don't work at all, okay? So one of the things that we have been asking, is there an agile, is there a faster way that you can go through the cycles of this adoption? Political leaders and bureaucrats want to see the light of the day. It's not their interest to entertain themselves on a software project for 36 months. It might be interest of some of the software guys just to entertain themselves, but leaders don't want it. Leaders want to see citizens' value unlocking on the ground. That's why I think we looked at it and we said, but how did private industries solve this? We have products, what's called commercial off-the-shelf products. If you want an email system, we don't start writing email system from scratch. If you want a word document, we don't start writing. If you want an HR system, if you want a manufacturing system, or a financial system, you don't start writing from scratch anymore. Why? Because much of that knowledge can be absorbed into something, what's called out-of-the-box, pre-product-ized offering. Now, in the private ecosystem, COTS products or commercial off-the-shelf product existed for a while. It's a no-brainer. Even government procures them. Second, recently, we will see software as a service is also becoming very popular. Why? Because you can convert your CapEx investment to OpEx. When you have a software as a service, because you can now say, I have half a million citizens, one dollar per citizen per year, five dollar per citizen, I want to run a digital signature or authentication system or something. So now your ability to actually move from custom building everything from scratch to product-ized offering, preferably cloud-ready, private cloud also. It can be in private cloud. It doesn't have to be in public cloud. But cloud-ready, that means fast rollout. And if you can create a cookie-cutter mechanism, we believe many of the DPIs can be accelerated. Not all. Now, don't take on the one exception and attack me, okay? There are some DPIs which will just take time, tough luck. Because it requires larger conversations, legislation changes, some of that, okay? No problem. Go through the normal route. But there are many, many DPIs. Education, health care, registries, farmer registries. It's not a legislation problem. You're already doing it. So how can we do it faster, cheaper? And that's a real question. So we called it DAS because it sort of sounded good. And DPI is a product-sized service. What does it mean is that we could take, unlike private intellectual property in the commercial product, when it comes to DPI, the kernel or the engine of the car, engine of the DPI, preferably should be open source. Preferably. Because it's becoming national critical infrastructure. You don't want your national critical infrastructure. If it's used by population, entire population, you don't want the engine to be completely locked out and then, you know, somebody can shut it off because you didn't pay and all kinds of things, right? So you can use digital public goods, DPGs, open source effort. And you know, you guys are doing it. We have many other open source effort here showcased. You can take an open source effort. But instead of saying, hey, go and take open source and do your own thing, you could actually take open source, create use cases, package it as if a commercial vendor will do. As if a commercial vendor. That kind of rigor of packaging. If you can get that packaging well, countries will benefit immensely. But that actually means now you can open up the DPI faster to the private ecosystem to create value-added layers on top of DPI. So you can use open source in the kernel or the engine, but on the periphery, there can be many, many types of applications. And they can all be private sector. You should encourage the idea of DPIs to encourage private innovation as well. So public rails, private innovation. I think that's the magic we are after. In a sense, if I associate, some of the APIs of the Linux kernel has not changed for the last probably 20 years. Right? If you follow the Linux kernel APIs. Yeah, operating system. Yeah, nobody needs to start writing operating system from scratch. But somebody needs to package it. Somebody needs to support it. Somebody needs to give you bug fixing SLAs. Somebody needs to train your people. Somebody needs to roll it out. Somebody needs to do business process engineering if required. So there is a significant layer of innovation you can do even if the engine is open source. Absolutely. I think internally inside MosaPromote, if you're not aware, there's a lot of thought process going on in terms of creating a marketplace where the value-added services could be built above the open source kernel core. It's completely commercial play. But at the same time, it doesn't lock the natural DPI that you're building in. It's built above it, and it's like a cookie cutter. So you could choose. You know the designs that are there in place. You know how it works. You build it or you buy it. The design and the interaction seems to be very standardized in a model. And I'm assuming that's a thinking process that you're going down and getting up. No, that's actually brilliant. If you are rolling out a DPI, and if you are thinking that you will do the whole thing yourself, you simply missed the point of DPI. DPI is to launch extremely minimalistic infrastructure and allow innovation by private sector and public sector. Wherever government is involved, they can also innovate, other departments. But wherever private sector, the advantage with private sector innovation on top of DPI is that their incentives to sustain the infrastructure is much higher, which is what we saw with payments. When we laid the payment rail, we had a reference application by the government just to get it started, to sort of bootstrap the system. But private sector took on like crazy, and they went and stuck QR codes in 100 to 200 million touchpoints. Government can't do. It's just expensive. And it's not worth doing all that thing. Build a highway and let private innovation thrive. Absolutely. The other interesting point, you spoke about the expensive, and it just hit me immediately. One of the conversations that we have been having, this is like three, four years of conversation that we are having. Every time we meet a country, discuss, or anyone, they will discuss, there is a considerable amount of cost and sustainability that comes into DPI. What do you think is the return of investment? Or I don't know, how do you actually compute this model to tell what does it cost for me to maintain and sustain this DPI for the next 15, 20 years like what you did in the UIDA and other places? What do you think? And how do you cost compute them? I think we can take the same learning from physical infrastructure as well. How do you sustain a highway? You apply something called toll charges. Toll charges are typically utility charges. It's not necessarily meant to, like profitability, to push profitability up. It's not a private sector for it to say, I want to be five times profitable. Just to sustain, right? What's called toll pricing models are what's called utility pricing models. Those pricing models that allow you to charge the utility to sustain. But you have to think like a utility. So first question you have to ask is that, people ask me, how long or how much money India, for example, took for DPIs. If you put together all the DPIs, identity, digital signature, which you and I wrote, yeah, DZ Locker, unified payment, which is a payment infrastructure which we did 12 billion transactions last month, plus data sharing infrastructure, combined in the last 15 years, India has spent less than 
**Video Transcript:**
> (Failed to download audio for transcription) billion. And we have 1.39 billion people on the ID system. We have 12 billion per month payments in the system. We have 1,300 G2P programs driving, I think, $70 billion every month, a total of $325 billion sent through G2P pipe. All this happened in the last 15 years. And the entire spend by the government so far has been less than 
**Video Transcript:**
> (Failed to download audio for transcription) billion. And identity was somewhat expensive for the lot because it was a sovereign function to give ID. But when it comes to data, credentialing, payment, we spent 
**Video Transcript:**
> (Failed to download audio for transcription) million to launch, or half a million dollars to build, and less than a million to launch, and we spent about that. Credentialing infrastructure in the last 10 years, we have spent $8 million. On the credential. Entire DZ Locker. DZ Locker, entire. 10 years. We have only spent $8 million. And that covers a pretty large population of the country. Today, we have 250 million users, 249 million users, with 6.5 billion credentials on that system. Total spend? $8 million. These are rounding errors. Think about it. Really, if you look at it. Now, it's funny, because why? In the DPI case, the cost gets distributed. That's the difference. When you build your highway, when you build yourself, you build your own transport vehicle, you run your own transport on top of the highway, you run everything yourself, then the cost accumulates. When you build just the highway, digital infrastructure, digital infrastructure, unlike physical infrastructure, is cheaper, the cost of adoption gets distributed in the ecosystem. And that's why the cost is, actual cost of DPI is very low, but the impact is high. Correct. The adoption goes into the ecosystem rather than the... Entire ecosystem. Because that comes back to the two success criteria. Population scale, unlocking of value for citizens, and unlocking value for private and public ecosystem. They will take the cost. Credentialing. We just walked out of a credentialing meeting. One of the countries, leading African countries, and they're going to literally start next week, I hope. It would be brilliant if they start. They will have it. If they do that. And the first question was that there are private universities, private schools, private colleges. Can private ecosystem go and actually support credentialing for them? That means workflows, mark sheet issue, and certificate issue, and workflows. Why should government go and solve all these things? So many workflows. So many systems. Can private ecosystem be incentivized? Answer is yes. And that's exactly how the cost is going to be distributed. By the way, we are asked to just cut off. I know we're like five minutes late, and I could continue this conversation for another half an hour. Thanks, Pramod. It was a pleasure to speak to you. Lovely to be here. I walked into this hotel, and energy was absolutely palpable. Unbelievable. Thank you. And somebody even hugged me even before I took shower. I don't know why. He said, yay, Mohsib Karni. Okay, whatever. It's brilliant. I love it. I love being here. Thank you, Prabhat. Lovely talking to all of you. Thank you. All the best. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> Gosh, I mean, I have been involved with DPI probably since the very beginning. I was working with Nandan on the sides on Aadhaar and around the right to privacy type of issues, worked a lot around the privacy principles that have to be built into an identity system and then most recently I got involved in DIPA, the Data Permanent Protection Architecture and that is a very privacy preserving type of architecture but it is a very different type of architecture and to explain that in the context of data protection laws as well as to explain to all the people who are building it, how to embed privacy data protection principles into the design of the infrastructure was where I was involved. Over the years in all the various DPI's, all these various issues that keep coming up around open markets, competition, open source software, then of course a lot of the contractual design and all of those sorts of things. So yeah, off and on maybe 15 years I have been hovering on the outskirts of the DPI ecosystem but very much working on the role of law and governance with DPI. The most important thing to understand when you are looking at governance for digital public infrastructure is that you have the traditional frameworks and the traditional frameworks are the waterfall as I see it is statutes and then contracts and statutes are broken up into constitutional provisions, then actual laws, delegated legislation which is regulations and once you have got all of that because governance is described by these things and this is all well before we get to contracts and then once you have sorted out the governance frameworks in this set of statutes and the set of documents, you then move to inter-party governance which is between the participants of the DPI ecosystem that is covered in contracts. But when you are thinking about DPI you have an additional way to look at this and that is that it is possible for you to build these legal principles directly into the code of the infrastructure and so really that is where I started from. I was like look we have got the laws, we have got the regulations, we have got the contracts but we can also actually embed these principles directly into the infrastructure and once you have that then I think it takes two levels of skill. One is to understand what the technology can do, what it is doing and then to understand how legal principles can actually be incorporated into the code and the design of the way the infrastructure is built. So I think that is where I started but as you get more and more into that you realize that look you can embed design legal principles into the design of DPI but you have to have some kind of contractual framework and then we rethought the way the contractual framework would be designed. These are all massive multi-party systems and so if you do traditional bi-partite contracts you will struggle and so we had to come up with this ecosystem participation terms concept where you have got this central pillar around which people sort of agree to participate based on their role. So it is a role based participation on a standard agreement depending on what role you have your obligations are inherited from the way in which that central pillar is designed. But even that is not enough. You need to have then actual institutional governance frameworks. So you need to have an institutional framework for who is going to decide what the protocols are going to be, who is going to decide what version two of the ecosystem participation terms are going to be and for that you need to have technical standards organizations which will determine what the protocols would be, what the next level of protocols would be and you need to have self-regulatory organizations which will within the sectoral ecosystem decide the actual way in which participation will take place. In many of these sectors you require certification and you require constant audits and you require various new features and new products that come out into the ecosystem. How do we ensure that they align with the legal principles? So that is the institutional governance design. So if I was just to sum up we have got the traditional provisions which is laws, regulations, contracts. You have got the ability to embed legal principles from laws, regulations, contracts directly into the code and then you have got governance of institutions that are required to maintain the code, that are required to evolve the code and also just maintain the ecosystem. And this is the full range of legal instruments that you have when you are working in this space. What is the point of building for the ecosystem? The point is that you are looking to build for the ecosystem. You are not building for an individual or for an individual entity. When you are building for an individual entity you will put in belts and braces. That is what we call it in legal terms. You will put in a clause and then you put in another clause even though that first clause dealt with everything you are like look I do not know maybe there is a need to put another clause in. And that is sort of the approach. Now when you are building for the ecosystem you are actually putting yourself in the shoes of all the participants of the ecosystem and you are trying to figure out what is in the interest of all these people. Now when you are thinking ecosystem you will realize that the belts and braces you would put in for just the one entity is actually coming in the way of the benefits to the other entity or the way in which the other entity will function. And when you realize that you start to strip down what your ask is because every asker link that you put in is something that you are detracting from someone else in the ecosystem in terms of what they can do or the mitigations they get etc. And therefore the only way to build ecosystem contracts where you are not the top, the head honcho of the ecosystem and everyone else is going to do what you say. You are literally negotiating this for the weakest chain in the link as well. In that type of environment you will find that you will actually build out the minimal, the most minimal contract. But I think it is one step further. I think when you build an end to end digital ecosystem a lot of what lawyers would traditionally put into a contract can actually be delivered through code. What do I mean by this? When we are engaging with each other as human beings, as persons, I cannot control how you perform. I can only impose an obligation on you under a contract. But if you are functioning in a digital ecosystem, the way the code operates is almost as good as a law. In which case I do not have to tell you to do A, B, C or I do not have to say that if I do A you will do B because the code is designed such that when it receives input A it will deliver output B. And I do not really now need to make this part of the contract because it will happen. So the next level of minimization that we took is we went through the workflows, the digital workflows and we eliminated from contractual obligations all those workflows that typically we would put into a contract but which are now being performed in code. And so the net result of these two actions was that we got a very minimal kind of a contract. And of course negotiating this is a challenge because the other side is so used to seeing the clauses in the contract that we had to tell them, okay, look you want the obligation, we will give you the obligation but we are actually giving the obligation in code. So you should not be negotiating liability, you should be testing whether the code actually performs as we promised it would perform. So it is a slight shift in the way in which the lawyers and the business people think. In other circumstances the business people are telling the lawyers, have you protected my downside. Now we are forcing the business people to tell the software developers, does the code perform as it is advertised. Because if it does then I do not have to insist that the lawyers put this in because it will perform as it is. So this is another shift in thinking that is only possible in these kinds of digital public infrastructure because it is at a sector wide level. Every entity in the sector that is performing this particular service is performing it on this digital infrastructure. And so we can make sure that the digital infrastructure itself is actually operating almost like a contract and ensuring that all the parties perform their contracts. And I will take it one step further because obviously if the digital infrastructure fails then some obligation will not be performed. If there is an outage and a server does not work and you have got a 9 layer set of events. At the 7th layer the server is not working and therefore the transaction does not complete. What we said was we will put in place dashboards. We will put in place red and green lights to say that if we started the transaction, if all the lights are green that means the transaction is through. If the light is red we will see how many of the 7 lights were green before it turned to red. And if the 5th light is red then we know that at that 5th transaction it failed. And so we have also got a very powerful dispute resolution mechanism to say that look it is your fault that the transaction did not go through because your server failed or because you know something happened at that place. And rather than put the blame on you know I do not know who, we will say look 7 people were supposed to do things. We did not know who did it. We now have to go to court and decide. We do not have to do any of that because the evidence is clear in the dashboard. So these are the features that you will get when you are trying to build governance mechanisms directly into code. The idea is in the governance and the legal frameworks for DPI we borrowed heavily from the actual principles of DPI. You know unbundling is an example. This minimization is essentially stripping out the things which are not important. That is a very DPI principle. We unbundle the DPI to its atomic element and then we put it together. We did the same thing with the contract. We stripped it down to its core elements and then we put it together. Modularity, we designed the legal framework such that there is an identity governance framework and that identity governance framework can be strapped on to a commerce framework such that you have an end-to-end solution for G2P payments where the identity piece and all the privacy protections around the identity piece is in that identity element. But that forms part of the entire G2P solution because the identity piece, the legal and the governance pieces around that is dealt with already in the system and we do not have to rewrite that again. So that whole reuse, modularity, all of those things are built in. And then federated data also keeping a lot of these systems federated such that we do not concentrate data into a single place. That is very much a data security obligation under various legal frameworks and that is how we implement that. So you are right. I think there are many borrowings that we have done from the way in which DPI as a technology has been built and the way in which the governance of DPI has been conceived of in this framework. I think we need to recognize that many things keep changing. None of these systems that we build are static and should not be static. I think a lot of the design of DPI is such that it can evolve. Evolvability is a core element of digital public infrastructure and evolvability therefore has to also be a core element of the governance of digital public infrastructure. So I had mentioned two institutions for governance, TSOs and SROs. TSOs are technical standards organizations. So to answer your question about new technologies, AI, but it could even be new products. We come into this financial services industry thinking that we want to give loans to people but actually we realize that we want to do wealth management for them. And so we need new products that are coming out and the protocols that we have written may be protocols for loans but we actually need protocols for wealth management. All of that will be dealt with by the technical standards organization which will say that look, now AI has come in and we need to make this available in multiple languages and rather than insist that it be translated in multiple languages, let us just make an API to plug a Bhashani type language in or some language translation in such that whichever country we are in the world, we can translate it to whichever language is relevant. That will be done by the technical standards organization because it may require a modification of the existing protocol to incorporate a new standard, a new technical standard. And then you have got the contracts, the legal frameworks, you have got certification and audit, various of these sorts of things that in a particular sector will be surfaced by a self-regulating organization. So an SRO or a self-regulating organization in a given sector is an entity or an institution that understands that space very well. So let us say in the financial services sector, you will have an SRO in the financial services sector to say look, when we are talking about data sharing or data exchange in the financial services sector, these are the problems that are coming up. People are saying that I need this additional new product or what you have built me works really well for loans but it is not working so well for wealth management, there are these additional features that I need. And then we will say that okay, now in order to put these additional features, we need some regulations or we need some additional certification. And then the SRO will come up and say okay, we need these amendments to be done from the legal side, the contractual side, the regulatory side and perhaps even the statutory side. And obviously the SRO cannot amend the laws that has to be done by parliament but the SRO can certainly say that on the ground we are finding these problems with the way the law works and so can we recommend this change. So these are the two ways in which I think is the most practical way in which you evolve. I think if you wait for legislators to make the change, they will only make the change once there is enough complaints in the system that this is not working, that is probably too late. Having SROs on the ground and TSOs on the ground are people who are actually implementing these DPIs and they are finding that there are some actual problems on the ground as we are implementing it and they can surface it up much faster. So this would be a way to actually evolve the legal frameworks at the same pace as DPI will evolve the technical frameworks. Extremely challenging, as you are saying, lawyers are only used to dealing with contracts and to convince them that this would perform in code was extremely challenging. Of course I had an ally in the fact that the first person I had to convince was Pramod. Pramod Rao was at that point in time the general counsel of ICICI bank and I spent a lot of time having this conversation with him. I wouldn't say a lot of time, compared to the total amount of time we spent trying to put this ecosystem together, it was actually quite easy to speak with Pramod and get him to understand. But once I could get him to understand, in a sense he was my ally and he would, having understood the power and the potential of this and in his own ecosystem realized that actually this will work, it was then much easier because we have got a general counsel of a big bank, well respected in the banking sector who could then go and in their own language convince other general counsels of other banks to say, look this is how we think it will work, we are comfortable with this, I think you can also get comfortable. And then of course there is a bit of a momentum with this, once 3-4 banks say yes it's okay and it's also when the transactions are working and you are finding that we really don't need these clauses, the code is performing as advertised, it becomes easier. So my experience with this is you have to put in a lot of effort to try and change the path the first time and with some time and as long as the system is effective, see the moment the system doesn't work then of course everything comes crashing down, the pendulum is going in the completely opposite direction. But so long as the system works as advertised and as more and more people are comfortable and convinced of it, then it works. When a country is looking to build a legal framework for governance, I think the instinctive response for any government is to try and see if I can build it into a law or regulation or something like that. My only advice to them is that you have another tool and that is to actually embed these legal principles directly into the infrastructure. You have the power to do it because you are the one who is signing off on the protocols that are being performed and you can insist that the protocols have certain legal functions. Now the power of this is that as much as you think your laws are powerful, your laws have to be enforced and as much as you've written it in the statute book, people can violate it until they get caught. The advantage of writing it into code is you cannot violate it at all because the code only performs in a binary way, either yes or no. And that is the power of instead of trying to put it into law that a hundred people will violate or maybe a hundred thousand people will violate before you actually get it to the court to adjudicate on. You can put it into the infrastructure so that no one can violate it. Now that is the power of understanding this approach and so I strongly urge countries that are looking to do this to actually first articulate what are the legal principles that they want to enshrine into their digital public infrastructure. It could be a combination of I want to have free markets, I want to ensure no monopolies can take place, I want to ensure that everyone has autonomy, I want to ensure that no data is taken without consent. Or it could be any slight subset of this. It could be in certain circumstances I want data to be sent because this is for the good of the country. Whatever it is, you have to decide up front these are the principles that I want to govern this particular sector. Some of those principles you have to enshrine into law and I think almost all the principles have to derive its sustenance from the constitution or some overarching legal framework that the country is bound by. But a lot of them instead of putting it into delegated legislation can actually be put into the code and the design of the infrastructure. And if you can do that you will get everyone participating on the infrastructure both the private sector parties, the government entities, everyone participating in that infrastructure will just by the act of participating in that infrastructure comply with the legal principles and the laws and the frameworks. And that is an extremely powerful thing for a country to have.








   10. Innovating on top of DPI – Mr. Nikhil Kumar (Co-founder, Setu) | DPI Masterclass  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoBtyIwPYWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoBtyIwPYWE) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoBtyIwPYWE&utm_source=chatgpt.com)


**Video Transcript:**
> My name is Nikhil, I am one of the co-founders of Setu. At Setu our mission is to make formal financial services affordable and accessible to everybody in India. The name Setu actually in Sanskrit means bridge and our big inspiration was if we look at open APIs or APIs, they are essentially nothing but software bridges that connect two different applications and that's how the name Setu came about. So we are essentially an API infrastructure company. What this means is if any developer or any institution wants to build, digitize a part of their financial services, whether it could be on payments, whether it could be in KYC or whether it's underwriting, we provide API infrastructure which is built on top of the digital public infrastructure that's available in India. The major goal of digital public infrastructure in a country like India is to broadly we can classify it to two large buckets. One is to bring down the costs of transactions. This could be through payments infrastructure, this could be through KYC infrastructure and so on and so forth. And then the second is to also bring down the cost of onboarding a customer which means you know accessing different data, making sure underwriting happens and so on. So in India when we think about making formal financial services affordable and accessible to everybody, one of the major important levers for us to think about in this century at this point in time is how do we use digital, how do we use the internet, how do we use technology to bridge the gap that exists between what people want and what institutions are able to serve. So essentially DPI brings down the cost of delivering these digital financial services. Now when the cost of delivering these services come down, what this means is now you will be able to serve a large set of customers who you were not able to serve before. For example, let's say today if you go to a bank and if you apply for a loan at a branch, the cost of processing that loan is anywhere around 5000 rupees or broadly say 80 dollars. So if this cost needs to go, if we need to basically enable let's say a small merchant who is selling snacks or coffee or tea, you know nearby your home or wherever, that person might just need the loan amount itself could be just 80 or 100 dollars. So you can't be spending 80 to 100 dollars as a cost of processing to give a 80 to 100 dollar loan, right, this economics never works. So the only way you can think about serving that particular customer base is by reducing your cost of processing and the cost of processing can be significantly reduced by using digital public infrastructure. So what does this mean? For example, the cost that would take for us to process an application offline at a branch which could be anywhere between 80 to 100 dollars can be brought down to a dollar by using digital public infrastructure. So when your cost becomes a dollar to process and you know apply application of a loan, you can now think about building sachet size products which could be for 100 dollar loans, could be even 50 dollar loans, it could be small insurances that people would want to buy on a daily basis, do savings, all of that is now possible which is why digital public infrastructure is very very important in a developing market like India. It brings down the cost of servicing customers and when that happens you will now be able to service a large set of customers and that's what our mission is. Let me take one example of a very good implementation of a DPI which is not so well known. So in India we have a bill payment system which is interoperable, open and accessible to everybody called the Bharat Bill Payment System. When it originally was designed it was thought about enabling digitization of bill payments which could be for utility payments like electricity, water, broadband, gas etc. What this meant is any consumer who is consuming these services from the government or even from a private agency need not go to the office of this particular service provider to pay their bills on a monthly basis but they could sit at home, use one of their favorite payment applications and complete a payment. But if you really look at the impact that it's having, how it's evolved is BBPS, the Bharat Bill Payment System also allows lenders or you know banks which are lending to customers to become a merchant or a biller on the system. So what this means is a consumer is now able to sit at home and also repay their loan without actually an agent needing to visit them, without actually a phone call and so on. So what this has done is for a lot of microfinance institutions, for a lot of NBFCs, for a lot of banks which serve in rural areas and underserved areas, it's brought down the cost of collections because just the mere act of sending somebody to your doorstep to collect cash and take that cash and go put it into let's say a nearest branch and then converting that into digital to you know if you look at the supply chain of the money, it's very expensive to do this. However in digital, the fact that the customer is sitting at home making a payment two clicks and the money reaches much faster, it's more efficient, it's super low cost, this is basically brought down the cost of collections for a lender. Now when you bring down the cost of collections for a lender, if you look at any lending industry, any lending customer, one of the major expenses that they have you know when they lend to customers is the cost of collections. So when you are able to reduce the cost of collections, you are reducing the cost of operations of a lender and as a result of that if the cost of operations come down, this means that the end borrower can actually get the loan at a lower cost. So this is how DPI is impacting at various different levels. So we might see the first order effect that it's low cost collection, but the longer term second order effect of this is that because the cost of collections has come down, the cost of operations come down and as a result of that the cost of borrowing comes down for the end borrower. So this is a good example of how DPI is being used in the digital financial services space. Generally, you know when fintechs and payment infrastructure or infrastructure companies have been built, you know you can think about companies being built on or companies building closed loop systems where you control the demand and the supply side and then you build value added services, products etc. Now one of the big problems of this is you are always limited to the supply and demand that you can build and you know it has its pros and cons. It has pros because it has bigger margins, but it has cons because you don't have a large base so you won't have large impact and so on. And then the other approach is to adapt to open loop technologies and then build on top of it. So when we were starting, we were very clear that rather than fighting DPI or open loop, we will completely embrace it and become an innovation layer on top of it because we genuinely believe over the long term consumers would love choice, interoperability will be more important and consumers seek this and it's also very good for the businesses which are interacting with these DPI's because at the end of the day they get cost benefits etc. So our major decision fork in our process of building our company and the startup was you know do we try and go the closed loop route or do we completely embrace open loop and we chose the latter and that was probably one of the major design decisions that we had to take when we started the company. So the good news about working on open loop is that it's just not you, it's actually being a part of the ecosystem. To me DPI in India has become more like a movement which has various different people right from banks who have been there for a long time to new innovators like fintechs which have come up to regulators, the government and everybody basically playing a role in coming together to make each of these DPI work and as a result of that you know as they say a rising tide takes everybody along, it's been one such journey for us right. So as far as the ecosystem is winning we will continue to win and we have seen tremendous progress we've made across payments, KYC and data infrastructure building on top of the digital public infra available in India. There are generally a lot of challenges when a DPI comes to life especially in a country like India where you have so many different stakeholders, various different people participating in it. The challenges start from you know what should be the standard operating procedures, how do we ensure data security, pricing and commercials, uptimes and SLAs and so on. Because one of the things we need to understand about DPI is you know you kind of give away some part of the process or control to other systems which are not under your control and this is really hard to do for many institutions because generally our mental model is the more you are in control the more efficient it is the better the results are. It takes some time for people to move from that to see benefits but because DPI has this beautiful innate virtue of creating network effects it always you know trumps over you know what an individual can do. Like they say you know the sum of parts is always more powerful than the part itself and it's one such thing and generally I think because of the experience of working and building and adapting multiple DPI's we've now created a kind of a playbook of what it takes for it to come to life, what kind of institutions are required to solve problems, what kind of governance frameworks are required, what kind of regulatory and legal framework is required to make it work. So that way I think you know as you start implementing and start using DPI you end up building some sort of a mental model and framework to solve these problems. Most of these problems are you know solved generally by keeping the individual's interest but rather thinking about the collective benefit all of us would get. This is little hard to do especially when companies are chasing profits but I think if we are all you know if we are committed to this problem if we all put our heads together because the opportunity is so large, the problems are so large, the impact is so large that no one institution or one individual can solve this. It takes the collective to come together and I think that's worked out very well for us in the India context. I do think that DPI is a level playing field. I would like to make a counter argument or this thing that typically our mental model says that okay you have incumbents and then you have you know innovators and the innovators come and eat incumbents breakfast or lunch but I actually think it also holds true in the other way around. If you are actually empathetic to incumbents so let's take a bank for example which has been around for let's say 50 years or 100 years and I have been doing things the same way. My parents were bankers so I am very empathetic to what happens in some of these bank board rooms and stuff where there is so much shift of technology and internet and everything that's happening around us in the world. It is really hard for a large organization to actually react to this and one of the reasons why innovators win is because their reaction time is very less. It's not like anyone's born with some special superpowers and so on but if you really cut down to the brass tacks it's that the fintechs or any new company is small in nature so decisions are made faster, your risk taking appetite is higher etc. etc. and so on and that typically gives them an edge and obviously one of the biggest beneficiaries of DPI is fintechs. They leverage it and so on but I do think the other side of it is like because the DPI exists and as a result of this there is some sort of a design language that's created that this is how a customer's onboarding would happen, this is how a customer's bill payment would happen or this is how a customer's KYC would happen. Now that started resulting in the banks and others also saying hey okay now that the regulator has blessed this, now that the government legal law enables us to do so, let's also follow these principles and it's cut down their time to actually make these decisions, get on top of it, leverage it and you know and challenge the innovators as well. So in some sense you know the level playing field kind of goes both ways where you know it does provide an opportunity for anybody with irrespective of how big or small they are to leverage it and use it to its best so that there's actual positive impact on the people that they're trying to serve. So that's how I would probably you know put this together that I don't think one loses or the other wins in this. It does create a level playing field where everyone has equal rights and you know right to win in this market. UPI is a beautiful example of this ecosystem coming together where banks play a very very important role as the payment service provider. Banks also play a very very important role as the custodian of the money of the customers but this they were also the enabler of you know FinTechs which are built on top of the payment service providers which you know could be the examples of phone pay, Google Pay, Paytm, WhatsApp and many others who have innovated on top of this layer and this has enabled the banks to continue to do what they do best which is essentially keep the deposits, the trust of their customers, do what they are best at in banking to bring in deposits, lend it to their customers and so on but at the same time enable superior user experiences on payments by creating this beautiful ecosystem of third party application providers, different FinTechs on merchant solutions etc. Where this lovely Jugalbandi, we use this word called Jugalbandi which is like a loosely used word to something like of a jazz band in India where everyone's got their instruments and they're all playing in harmony and they're in a flow state. It's a very good example of everybody coming together and the incumbents actually partnering with FinTechs or innovators and shaping disruption. I do think that you know there's a lot of unnecessary focus spent on people talking about profit pools in the DPI itself. The fact that it's called digital public infrastructure is to say that this fundamental infrastructure is like a public good. By definition, by design, it's meant to help the society at large to solve large problems like for example in our daily lives it could be roads, it could be bridges, it could be metro, train tickets etc. You can't expect it to be super profit making and so on because these are fundamental utilities that are necessary and DPI is basically nothing but the digital version of these infrastructure or public goods. So I think that we need to clearly understand that that's what the role and the definition of that part is and for everything else like how roads created commerce because businesses started interacting with each other and because as a result of that commerce got built. Similarly, you have internet and you have like all these platforms on top of it like Google and Facebook and many other companies or Amazon that got built on top of this. They created tremendous value. So I think it's important to understand that DPI is a value creation layer but not a value capture layer. So DPI enables value creation but it's not the layer in which you capture value. So it's very important to have this mental model that it's an enabling infrastructure and then your job as an entrepreneur or as an innovator or someone working in a large company is to actually think about how do I best leverage this DPI to build new businesses, new products, new services where I can capture value. For anybody who's thinking of building on top of DPI, there are probably two broad advices that I would give them. One is to embrace DPI and not fight it because it's one of those fundamentally important things from a principles perspective. I do believe that the principles that DPI stands for will always trump profits and arbitrage etc. etc. and so on because the principles of interoperability, being open, being extensible, they're like little bit of like physics of sorts, laws of physics. It's so fundamental that it will always trump over, if you're thinking about it from a business law of physics perspective, I think it is always fair to assume that this will trump over whatever that you might think. So my first advice would be to embrace it and not fight it, whether you're an incumbent or whether you're a newcomer, I think it's important to embrace it. The second advice that I have is a lot of people might feel that hey by building the DPI, you've taken away profit pools. So what do I do now? How do I make money? Where do I add value and so on and so forth? I think it's very important to understand that as time goes by, there are a few technologies, there are a few things which will become bare necessary. For example, at some point in time, water might have been a very, or it's becoming a scarce resource, but then there's so many applications as a result that it's available. A more recent one that we all experience is the internet. So one can argue and say, hey, why don't we pay high prices for internet? It had so much value, etc. But they're all enabling layers. So we tend to typically forget the value that gets created on top of this fundamental infrastructure and focus too much on the fundamental infrastructure itself. So my advice to people would be to think about how do you add value on top of this layer irrespective of whichever area that you're working on, because DPI needs to be thought about as a building block that's available to you, which makes it easy, which makes it accessible for you to build on top of. But it's not the end of what you need to build. It's the beginning. It's the first brick that you're going to probably lay when you're building your company or your product or service. And then you really need to think about what are the value added layers that I can do on top of it, which is adding value to my customers, where I can capture value and build a profitable business. So these would be my two things. One is embrace and second is innovate on value creation on top of the DPI.

**Video Transcript:**
> So, when we think about what makes DPI scale, just before, it's not a technology scale per se, okay, it's important. DPI scale comes from its design, it's a way of thinking, it's a way of rolling it out, a way of getting it adopted. Many of those go into the scaling aspect of DPI. But before that, let's quickly check, just make sure that we are on the same plane in terms of what is DPI versus traditional digitization. There's a lot of confusion, people say everything is DPI, solutions are DPI, or digitization is DPI. It's okay, because it's just a term, not a big deal, but I think the real question for us is to, for us, we nuance it a little more. Nuance it in such a way that digitization is the way of bringing, you know, digital technologies to solve a particular thing. Digitization is a superset. So you might digitize citizen governance, you might digitize healthcare systems, you might digitize payment systems and other systems, you might digitize a banking system. You can digitize everything, because computers can be brought in. But DPI is a subset. That's important to understand. DPI differs from traditional digitization in precisely two ways. One, DPI is not the whole solution. DPI is one component of many, many solutions that will come about later. So essence of DPI is reuse of that component. So you have to create something that is reusable. In the physical world, you would say a tire in a car is a component. It's not a car by itself, you know, it's just a tire. Or, you know, a steering wheel is just a component. By itself, you can't do anything with it. You need the whole car. But these components make the assembly of the car faster, cheaper, when you make these components independently. So DPI is the same thinking in the digital world, where you create reusable components or services that are minimal in nature, but definitely focusing on the reuse aspect of it. And the second part of the DPI thinking is that who reuses them? We must ensure that when you create a reusable building block or a component, it's reusable by the ecosystem, private and public ecosystem. So both private and public or public and private ecosystems must be able to leverage this DPI building block as they build additional layers of solutions. And this is why things like identity, things like just moving money, payment, or components like GTP mapper for government to person payment, credentialing as an architecture infrastructure that you can do, by itself doesn't solve anything. It's just one component in the overall digitization journey that you have to go through. But digitization without DPI means everybody will rebuild this component again and again and again. So you have to make this generic components or building blocks reusable and independent of the solution. If you can do that, you have achieved the biggest transformation that you would see that you would start having the GPS effect. GPS was a reusable building block. All it said is where you are. And then you could combine that with smartphone, internet connectivity, and reimagine Uber, something like that. And ride hailing was reimagined. So very, very powerful possibility exists if you can re-internalize this idea that if we are able to create reusable building block, reusable by private and public ecosystems, then many, many subsequent solution get faster and cheaper. So this is very important starting point. Now when we build the DPI itself, now that we have understood it is just a component, it's just a building block, it's not the whole thing, we have to think about how do we design that one component. That's where the design principles come into play. Minimalism very, very key. Maximalism is not what you're looking at. Minimalism is what you're looking at. Reusability, that means it has to be designed as a context invariant or context generalized, context invariant block. You should not assume, oh, ID is going to be used for bank account opening, and hence ID system has some bank knowledge. Then how will it be used for health care? How will it be used for something else? How will it be used by private parties for maybe a airport check-in or a hotel check-in? So that means ID system should not be aware of the context in which ID is used. That means context invariant or context free building blocks have to be designed. So first one is minimalism. Second thing is context free, generalized design. And third is to design as a reusable through policies. So you have to create policies and technology readiness in terms of application programming interface and all APIs and all that thing so that it gets reusable. Whether it's online reusable, offline reusable, you can look at all those scenarios and make sure there's a policy and technology readiness for reusability as well. That's primarily what you do. If every component is built this way, minimal, generic, reusable, then we are suddenly, country will have a basket full of reusable component that now a solution builder can assemble faster and cheaper to build solutions. That is the essence of scaling. What do you mean by scaling? It's not just technology scaling, right? It is the program scaling, scaling of the DPI adoption, usage. So issuing identity is only one part. If identity is not used by banking system, healthcare systems, you know, benefits delivery systems and private innovations and public innovation, job, employment systems, if they're not used, why did you issue the ID, right? So it is important to think about designing scale into the DPI, not as a technology scale, the scale of the whole system. That means why would it be adopted? What is the incentive structure for adoption? What is the policy unblocking for adoption? What is the technology barriers for adoption, cost barriers for adoption? You have to ask these questions beyond the pure technology scale. Of course, if you put out an API, application programming interface on a cloud service, private or public cloud, obviously technology has to scale. But that's only a small portion. Technology is only a small portion of DPI scaling. DPI scaling is primarily because you cracked the incentive structure for individuals and entities, private public entities in the country. If you can crack that incentive structure, support through policy to remove friction, support through technology friction through capacity building and funding and all that thing to remove that friction. So remove the friction for adoption, crack the incentive, two things. Crack the incentive so that they know why should I use it otherwise. There's no incentive. Then why would anybody use it? So crack incentives for people and systems and remove friction for adoption. Once the incentive may be high, demand may be very high, but friction is very high. Then demand is high, but friction is high and it's not taking off. Or demand is not there. Then this won't take off. So cracking that incentive, demand structure is very key and removing the friction barrier. Friction comes primarily from policy friction, technology friction and cost, time friction, capacity friction. You have to analyze that and make sure that's removed. Scaling is precisely that. So DPI, most of the people think DPI is about tech. DPI has absolutely very little to do with tech. DPI is a way of thinking. It's a way of thinking in first to generate the component, building block, create a reusable, context-free building block. Then making sure there is incentive alignment for everyone to adopt it and removing the friction for adoption. If you do this, DPIs will scale. This is why it is also important to understand a copy-paste of a DPI may not work. Same DPI in one country might be high value. Demand may be very high. Value to the society may be high. Friction may be low. But in other society, like identity, in a developed country, nation, where the civil registries and existing IDs already exist, one more ID may not add any more value. So you have to really ask this question. Is there societal value, high value and low friction? You have to get into that quadrant, high value, low friction quadrant, and make sure your DPIs that you are rolling out falls into that high value, low friction quadrant. Then you build it generic, build it reusable, and remove the barriers, policy and technology and cost barrier for adoption. That's what. And very little to do with tech. So it's a way of thinking. I think it's much to do with thinking about scale. And I'll end with this, saying many people make mistake of thinking I will do an experiment in a highly controlled, small geographic area and hope that suddenly it will work for a billion people. What works at scale is different from scaling what works. And what works at scale comes from the original design. The design itself should work. You should think about scale. And you have to simulate in your mind what could go wrong, what could go wrong, why at scale anything that can go wrong, and design some of that into the design of the program or design of the tech in the DPI. If you don't design what works at scale, you cannot take a proof of concept and try scaling. It's very different. And that is something which I'll end with. So think scale from day one. Scale of incentives, scale of ecosystem, scale of use cases, scale of everything. Think everything from scale perspective.

**Video Transcript:**
> One of the DAS offerings for the country is Auth as National Digital ID Auth and Single Sign-On, Authentication and Single Sign-On capability. Now this is slightly nuanced, slightly different from the issuance of the ID itself. So this is not an identity project, they are a foundational ID project or other functional IDs like driver's license and passports and so on. Every country has them, many countries are building them. This is not a replacement for that. While some countries are building a fresh digital native identity, we still believe in the long run, and this is definitely India's experience as well, is that they will exist multitude of functional and one foundational ID maybe, but multiple functional IDs. Not everything is going to collapse into one because privacy reasons, you know, resilience of a country, many reasons why multiple IDs are a good thing to do. But when it comes to digital authentication, especially for government services or even private services for that matter, it's difficult for individuals to log in to a website or single sign on to a website, avail various government portals, government systems using one ID, right? It is a fantastic capability if citizens have a mechanism to create their profile and use that profile, like Google profile, to actually log in to various services and avail services. So this is a DAS package is not an ID package. This DAS ID auth package is a thin DPI, it's a lightweight DPI that the value that provides for citizens is that it allows citizens to create a profile and allow citizens to do single sign on and authentication to various services that they might have to interact in their lifetime with. So they have a choice of using that as their digital ID authentication mostly. And this is even more important because with cybersecurity being as important thing, authentication gets broken. So many, many departments struggle to actually keep authentication safe and they ought to keep it safe. User ID, password or whatever they're trying. One of the things we are actually arguing is that there is no reason why thousands or hundreds of departments or hundreds of different ministries of service provider really should be maintaining their own password. It's a pain for citizens for sure. But in addition, it's actually a cybersecurity risk. So providing a choice or national authentication layer and single sign on layer as a choice to the citizen is a brilliant value unlocking. And that requires a very lightweight DPI that allows citizens to sign up, verify their profile against an existing ID. So their profile can be verified by national ID, driver's license, passport, whichever country has it. Then use that to sign up, sign in, sign in to many, many services, whether for food services, education services, scholarships or whatever they're reaching out. This also gives very interesting proposition for the country in addition to better cybersecurity, better citizen value, convenience. In addition to those, it also allows for those countries who have not yet navigated to a digital, all digital ID system, who are already quite happy with their existing ID system, which is not fully digital, maybe a card based ID or some other form of ID like passport, can now use this layer to provide a digital layer, auth layer on top of an existing physical ID. So this is a brilliant, you know, coming together of a digital ID layer on top of physical ID, still providing the citizens with that value unlocking capability. So we believe many countries can actually go with this Dash package quite fast.








   13. Digital Credentials | DaaS: DPI as a Packaged Solution

**Video Transcript:**
> One of the DAS products that we have been looking at that countries can actually deploy is the verifiable credentials. And we have spoken many times, I think, the Center for DPI has a tremendous set of resources that you put together around the world. Why verifiable credentials is a hot topic around the world. Most people have understood that if I receive a certificate, academic certificate, birth certificate, vaccine certificate, salary certificate, income certificate, it doesn't matter. Today, these certificates are either on paper or a PDF version of the paper. Neither of them are verifiable. Why is it important to get it verified? What is the use of providing these credentials or certificates back to the individual? What is the purpose? Is that I can actually reuse it for some other purpose. So I can go to take these academic certificates and apply for a job or I can take my income certificate and my maybe my property certificate and go to a bank for a loan, right? That's a real purpose of credentials or certificates is that reuse comes back. But unfortunately, with paper or PDF, using today's technology, it's extremely easy to fake it. I mean, so easy to fake it that, you know, you don't even need speciality to fake it, right? Now, the trouble that comes from the fact that you can fake paper and PDF is that the accepting party now stops trusting. That means if I provide my income certificate or my degree certificate or academic certificate, the overhead of verifying is actually with the accepting party. The accepting party can't verify this paper because I don't know whether it's genuine. So that means they have to do all the costly background checks, verification and all that thing before they can accept this paper for providing a service or a good. The cost of that verification, when it becomes high, it creates extreme friction in the system and most people get denied saying, you know, I can't serve you because much of the things you are saying are unverifiable and much of this paper is unverifiable. Now, we have a fake sense of security sometimes, you know, you show government ID card or government certificate, somehow people accept it. But today's world, it's so easy to generate, which is also what is reason why in the digital world, in the digitally native world, it's quite easy. And especially with vaccine certification, most of the countries have started doing that to convert these certificates and documents and data sets that we are providing back to the citizen, converting them into a verifiable format. That means I can still use the paper because inclusion is key. I can still use the paper printed, but I can put a digitally signed QR code. That one thing that completely changed the trustworthiness of that paper and reduced the cost of acceptance at one shot. And vaccine days, we did, a lot of countries did that. India is doing that for many, many documents, including academic. So we can repeat this for many, many certificates, right? But this needs two things. One, open standards so that we can actually do open standards to create trust. And there are global standards, open standards, so we can adopt that. And we need some software to create such QR codes and issue what's called issuance type of software and accepting type of software. The DCS package, digital credentialing, you know, sort of suite of DAS products that we hope to bring it out to the countries is providing this out of the box in one sense, of course, with open source so that countries are not hostaged in any proprietary technology at all, completely open source in the control of the country. But they can rapidly roll out their national credentialing strategy. And that doesn't, no reason a country should take a year or two years to do anything like this. They should be able to do in two, three months. They should be able to launch this. And it's a journey. Not all certificates gets verifiable on day one. You know, Rome was not built in a day one. It takes time. But I think countries will find ways to convert every one of the certificates.

**Video Transcript:**
> AI is the talk of the town. Everybody wants to do AI. Everybody believes there's a power in AI. And we actually, when we look at from some of our experience in India as well, we see it's a fantastic combination of DPI thinking and AI. It's very powerful. People ask, sometimes get confused about is DPI versus AI or DPI and AI. It's very, very clear in our mind that DPI and AI are orthogonal. That means two different things. But when you combine, you get brilliant nonlinear value unlocking. And this can happen because DPI truly, if a population scale or a societal scale transformation need to happen, it needs to go all the way to the last person. A DPI penetration, whether digital payments, digital ID, credentialing, anything that we speak about, healthcare, education should reach everyone. But that's hard because language barriers, tech barriers, device barriers, information asymmetry barriers. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel. So poor people, a lot of people at the bottom of the pyramid finds it extremely hard to join this digital movement because they are kept aside due to many barriers. We believe connectivity and device barrier will go away because the world over, you know, it's being addressed. We don't have to address them because that's... Much of global South is actually young population. So aspiration is not a problem. I think the young population of Africa, India, everywhere, they'll embrace tech faster than the older generation. So that's not a problem for much of global South. Then what is a problem? We have been looking at a few things. Language barrier as a big deal, huge issue, and information asymmetry barrier as a huge issue of interacting and doing, engaging into a formal economy, right? If I were to engage for a job application and for something and so on, you know, I need to... I can't speak in English. I need to cross that barrier. AI is peculiarly suited to bridge this barrier. So imagine if we ever laid the DPI education, financial inclusion, healthcare DPI or agri DPI are starting to come. You infuse that with AI capability for bridging that gap, barriers, gap between information asymmetry barrier, language barrier, and other capability barriers. If we can bring AI to bridge that gap, truly the power of DPI will reach the last person. Because otherwise we'll always see the DPI is reaching about 50, 60% of the country, 70, then it starts to taper. It is very hard to get to the last 20, 30% is the country because they're very, very underprivileged in one sense and they need extra support to come. Other than financial support and device support, which other people are doing, AI we believe truly can provide that. And so we are hoping to bring out a DASH package that will solve knowledge asymmetry through and conversational interaction rather than read a 50 page PDF about a government scheme. Who can read, who can understand, who can assimilate that and take an action. So there, you know, the barrier is high. Can we actually bring access to justice we speak about, access to financial inclusion schemes that I don't know about, how do I know, how do I participate? How can that bridge be dramatically reduced through GPT, multilingual capability and conversational capability brought into other very, very powerful because that knowledge asymmetry is the first barrier that we can remove. Second is language based interaction. We believe that also we can be packaged to provide local language, human, not perfect grammar, right? Human speak with multiple languages, multiple words, you know, numbers combined, grammatically incorrect. We pause, recreate sentences. Can computer interaction become much more human, natural? That will bridge the last gap. AI is very, very specially suited to that and we are really excited to bring these two dashed packages, information asymmetry part and as well as language barrier part as, you know, to the other countries, to many countries who would probably see the same pattern in their economy as well.

**Video Transcript:**
> We are looking at three or four DAS packages to start with. No, it's only begin with. We will have more and more packaging. Various DPGs could actually be packaged into DAS as we sort of mentioned earlier. But G2P mapper and registries are a peculiar high demand DPI that many countries have been asking whether they are functional registries like hospital registries or registry of doctors, verifiable registry of farmers, farmer registry, teacher registry, student registries and so on. People have been, many countries have been as part of their either vertical, they have been implementing registries in some form. But one of the arguments we have been making is that if you want it to be a DPI truly, then you cannot keep it as, you can't build a database and use it for yourself. Then it becomes a part of digitization, but it's not a DPI because that database is not available as a verifiable source of truth to other people in the ecosystem, maybe other government departments or private players as well. And even for individuals, a farmer for example, if I am verified by you as a department and put me in the registry, it's good to get a credential saying that you are a verified farmer, right. Then I can use it in a bank for a lending and so on. So there is a lot of power that you can unleash if you convert from imagining this as a database versus a registry. Registry simply means it's verifiable, trusted source of truth and it opens up application programming interfaces for ecosystem and it also gives the power back as a credential back to the subject of the registry, farmer, doctor, whoever the subject. Now India has built for example vehicle registry. You can even think of entity registry, registry of things, vehicles and you know farm equipments and anything that you want to allow verifiability and reusability. And G2P mapper is a very peculiar type of registry that allows government to person payment when that happens. Today payment can happen to bank accounts or wallets but because of the various differences in the payment system, the way you send that money, the way you specify what is the destination account details is very custom. If it's a bank account, I have to specify it in a particular way. If it is you know wallet, mobile wallet, I have to specify it in a different way as to the mobile number and so on. For a government though, the problem with this scheme is that it doesn't become portable. That means if an individual who is receiving this benefit from the government changes his or her bank or moves from one part of the country to another bank because now I want it in my mobile wallet instead of bank. Every system that is sending me money has to now go change because everywhere I have to update these details. The G2P mapper that we talk about precisely addresses that issue saying my identity, national ID or whatever identity I am using is not changing. So can you send money to my identity instead of directly to my bank account? What it means is that the address in the payment instruction is my identity and in the map we map between the identity and the destination account, actual account. The advantage of this aliasing through this mapper, advantage of this aliasing is that no systems need to change their data when you change a bank account or when you change it because you can keep on sending it to the identity. Identity gets mapped to the latest bank account, whichever bank account you are using and so it gets not only permanency of sending money irrespective of where you are, who you bank with, I can send you your pension or scholarship or whatever. Permanency is also addressed, portability is also addressed for individual to make it easy through a mapper. It is an extremely special purpose registry that is actually keeping this mapping. So both registries and mapping we believe can also be DAS packaged and allow countries to roll out either registries or mapper in 3 months time. India has rolled out few registries actually in 4 weeks and 5 weeks and so, it is quite straightforward. Of course we need to work through the policy with the countries and so on but nevertheless it is quite straightforward. We believe it is a good candidate for a DAS package.

**Video Transcript:**
> Good afternoon, my name is Engineer Alain Reussof, and I'm the Director of Software and Biometrics at the National Identity Management Commission, which is a government ID solution provider in Nigeria. The history of ID has taken a very long time in Nigeria. Most countries have the challenge of identifying their citizens. So in Nigeria, we had the first well-known ID project, which is in 2003. This was an out-of-the-box ID project, which was concessioned to a French company called Sagem, and they were able to capture about 56 million Nigerians at that time, and they issued an identity token. Unfortunately, after that program, the data, because it's a proprietary solution, the government at that time could not use the data, don't have access to the data. So that led to an enactment of an act of creating the National Identity Management Commission in 2007. With that act, in collaboration with the Department of Civic Registration at that time, created the NIMC, and we started the project afresh. And that's the project that we started, whereby the project was conceived so that there would be an enrollment solution, and you capture Nigerians, issue an 11-digit identification number, also issue a token, which is the card, a multipurpose card, and as well get involved with harmonization and integration with other identity agencies, where in this case, driver's license, the National Population Commission that is responsible for birth and death, and also the Nigerian Immigration Service that is responsible for issuing passports. Also, in addition to capturing, one of the roles is that you must capture the 10-fingerprint biometrics, and also capture the picture, which is face. Then the third modality, which is IRIS, we've not included IRIS, but there's a working plan to do an upgrade, to include IRIS as the third modality of biometric identification. Yeah, the lesson learned from the fallout from the Initial Identity Project is that the introduction of the local content. In this project, the software, the enrollment software, was designed and developed by local vendor. We have also, as a commission, developed an in-house enrollment application. Another layer that has happened in this case is the introduction of verification. What is the use of having an identity if you cannot verify? There's digital verification, whereby real-time verification, and then verification also with provisions for API, whereby other stakeholders, in this case government agencies, and also the private individuals to plug in. That has seen a lot of interest. We've been able to plug in the financial institutions, the banks, for luminary verification. By rule now in Nigeria, you cannot procure a passport or renew an existing passport without having the national identification number. So the NIN is embedded and coded on the passport. We are working with the Vehicle Registration Authority, whereby driver's license also, you will need to have an NIN to get your license. Also, we have PENCOM, which is the pension commission, whereby also to get those benefits, most of these government services, you need to have an NIN. What is the use of NINs? For example, one of the key private shareholders that are consuming the verification service are the telcos, the mobile telephone companies. It is by law now that for you to have a SIM card, you must have an NIN. Also, we've seen other use cases whereby employers of labor, both private and government, are requesting for NIN. We're also moving towards probably the airlines before they sell you a ticket or before you board a plane or get some services like hospitals, health care insurance. You need an NIN. So it's becoming viral and important to some of the services, both government and private, that citizens and legal residents consume. What are the challenges of the NIN? Absolutely, there are challenges. We've been able to... We are managing the challenges. There are still challenges, but they've reduced significantly. One of the major challenges is acceptance. Because of the level of literacy, most people still don't understand the idea that why would they need an identity. Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world where you can travel from north to south and nobody asks you for any means of identification. Few years ago, you can board a plane or enter public transport without identification, but that is changing now. That tells you the level of awareness. We also have... In that case, up to 2015, we had only about 7 million enrolments, but we were able to ramp up enrolments because of collaboration. One of the major collaborators that really advanced our cause are the banking system, which is the Nigeria Interbanking System. We harmonised about 15 million records of the BBN. We adopted those that meet the criteria. We were able to bring them on board and generated an NIN for them. Right now, we have about 103 or 104 million records in the database. It is projected that the estimated population of Nigeria is between 200 and 230. At this point, we can say that we have captured about 50% of the population. We are making much advancement and the awareness is becoming more now because of some of the key services that you cannot consume those services without having an NIN. We do believe that NIN has come to stay. Also, to make things easier in terms of verification, we have introduced digital ID. We have moved from issuing a piece of paper to having a digital copy on your phone or your smartphone. This is just to make life easier for the citizens and some of the benefits of what the National Identification System provides. We are also aware that a lot of citizens are unbanked because some of them live in areas where there is poor communication in the rural area. We have tried to make things easier for them. We partner with, we give licenses to private companies. We call them the front-end partners, whereby they can go to the interlands to places where they have to get areas to capture citizens. We have seen a lot of interest in that. Community leaders have been, public awareness has been made known on TV, on radio, on jingles, to make sure that every community is aware of the importance of the National Identification Number. Also, recently, there will be government programs like palliatives that the poorest of the poor will enjoy. One of the criteria is that for you to qualify for this program or for you to get this benefit, you must have your NIN. So we do believe that this will also increase adoption. We bring more people who naturally wouldn't have come for the service, will come to get registered for this NIN. Our next step is right now, the World Bank is already also picking trade. There's a program that's supporting Nigeria with a grant, whereby it is believed that within three years, we're supposed to be able to capture every Nigerian. So usually funding has been the challenge, but with this relationship with the World Bank, I think we will get some funds that will assist in wrapping up or concluding the enrollment. But identity is an ongoing process. We cannot capture everybody, because the projection in Nigeria is that newborns, we have about 7 million, 7 to 8 newborns every year. So you have 7 to 8 million people to capture yearly. And also modifications, people change names, people change addresses. So these are also services that you need to update your data, which we increase by the day, and the National Identity Management Commission will be on their toes to make sure they are ready and able to provide these services. So again, cross-border relationship, without standards, it will be difficult for you to move from one country to another. So one of the main reasons why we're here in India, in Bangalore especially, is to work with agencies to adopt the MOSIP program, whereby it is developed based on open source so that we can increase efficiency and be able to bring services to different stakeholders due to interoperability so that the foundational identity can drive the economy, both in financial and all other sectors of the economy. Well, they need to be proactive and know that it's a big project. The same way Nigeria, despite the fact that we've covered about 50% of the population, we're here in India to see how to learn from what India has done, to have 1.3 billion citizens and about 90% captured into the database is something to cherish. So we're here to learn and to adopt best practices. So any other country that also would like to start an identity program, you look at where it's been done before. There is Pakistan, there is India, there is now Nigeria, and there are a few countries also in Africa that have adopted best practices and came up with identity program that works for their community, but most importantly, based on well-known and acceptable standards so that there can be interoperability. So thank you again for the opportunity and thanks to our new Director General, Engineer Abisola Koka Odusote, who is now the new champion of identity. We're here to look at best ways of doing things, looking at best practices and also incorporating open source to make sure that what we have is sustainable and also to partner with other stakeholders, especially the financial sector, to make sure that all the services that they provide for the citizens are done in real time and to the benefit of the country. Thank you so much.

**Video Transcript:**
> Good morning, good afternoon, good evening everyone. Welcome, thank you so much for joining. So a huge thank you to everyone for joining us today for our latest event in our Regulator Knowledge Exchange series. I'm delighted you to welcome today to today's event entitled Designing Open Finance as Digital Public Infrastructure, Lessons from India and Brazil. The event is being hosted in collaboration with the Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure and for the Bank for International Settlements. Before we get started, a little bit about me. My name is Nick Clark. I'm the head of the Regulatory Innovation Hub here at Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. We lead research, digital tool development, and capacity building programmes with financial authorities on the regulation of FinTech and digital financial services. Prior to joining the Centre, I worked at the Financial Conduct Authority in London for over a decade, laterally managing the FCA's regulatory sandbox. My interest is in the regulatory approaches to innovation and emerging technologies, which is why I'm very much looking forward to today's discussion. Our panel session today is part of our Regulator Knowledge Exchange event programme. As a peer-led and community-driven digital platform, the RPE is now providing a place where central bankers, financial regulators, supervisors, and policymakers can meaningfully connect, learn from their peers, co-create solutions, and collaborate by harnessing the power of community. On this note, on behalf of CCF, may I extend a special welcome to the RPE members who are joining us today. So, to today's session, over the next 75 minutes, we'll hear from world-leading experts sharing practical insights and lessons learned from India and Brazil on the design and implementation of open finance. We're so grateful to have such distinguished guest speakers with us today. Now, just to set the scene a little bit, CCF works with regulators and financial authorities from all over the world. Some of the countries we speak to are well advanced in their open banking implementation journey and already have in place infrastructure which allows providers to access transaction data from banks. Other jurisdictions are just beginning this journey, taking their first steps towards conceptualization and design of open banking frameworks which will work for them. And of course, there are many places which are somewhere in between these two points. While open banking covers both payments and data sharing, open finance extends data sharing to other non-banking actors in the financial ecosystem, such as insurance, securities, and pensions, providing access to consumers' entire financial footprint. Open finance is an exciting and ambitious area and many financial authorities are considering their role in its development. It is clear, however, that open finance as a broader data sharing initiative will require coordination and consistency across stakeholders and sectors. Digital public infrastructure is the rail upon which private and public sector actors can innovate and build new applications and products that benefit consumers, including those who are currently underserved. Open banking and open finance rails are examples of this DPI approach and this is why I'm incredibly excited about today's session. By sharing the successful approaches to open finance among our regulatory community here today, we can learn the lessons of others, consider these insights in our own open finance implementation journeys. And on that note, I would like to welcome you, our audience, and hand over to CCF fellow and my wonderful colleague, Bill Roberts, who will introduce our esteemed panel members and lead us through today's discussion. Bill, over to you. Thank you, Nick. Well, as Nick said, we have four distinguished speakers who've kindly agreed to share with us learnings on various aspects of open finance from their different organisational and national perspectives. They are Kamiya Chandra, Chief Strategy Officer at CDPI, the Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure. Dr Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Otavio Damalso, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil and Yin Huang, Special Advisor to the Chief Representative for the Bank of International Settlements. After we've heard from all four of them, I will moderate a Q&A session. So could I ask you to post your questions to our speakers in the chat and I will field them to the speaker you specify after all have spoken so we don't interrupt any of the speakers. As to say apologies in advance if we don't get round to your particular question in the time allotted today. We have a very, very large audience of regulators participating in today's session. So my apologies in advance if we don't answer all the questions today. Right. So our first speaker is Kamiya Chandra. Kamiya, I hand the virtual mic over to you. Thank you. If you'll allow me to share my screen, you can stop sharing. Perfect. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Just to give you a bit of context, my name is Kamiya Chandra. I'm the Chief Strategy Officer at the Global Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure, which provides pro bono technology architecture advice to countries that are building open banking and open finance among other digital public infrastructure. We work with over 30 countries in this area. Quite happy to be here today. Let's dive in straight. I think we strongly believe that financial inclusion at scale can be achieved in a country's lifetime. It may sound like an ambitious statement, but in just a few years, with a few targeted actions, we believe that it's truly possible to uplift millions into the formal financial ecosystem. And we believe this happens in three phases. First, we think it's important to enable people to access the formal financial system, those who don't even have accounts. And that first formal account is typically done through the digital public infrastructure of a low cost electronic KYC. If you're from a country where formal financial accounts are ubiquitous, nearly every adult is banked, then this may not be a concern for you. If you're from an emerging economy, where you maybe have some challenges with an unbanked population, this is an important precursor to first bring in people into accounts that can be used to transact with payments and data sharing. Then you get into the second phase of what we call engagement, which is the payments layer, which allows for people to actually use those newly created accounts to actually transact in their everyday lives. The important thing in building this kind of infrastructure is to make sure that it works for low value and high volumes of payments. So that means the street vendor on a road that is selling their merchandise for an extremely low value should be able to accessibly access digital payments. And that happens when digital payments is inclusive, it's interoperable and instant. Usually we focus only on the instant through real time payments. And that's where open banking or open finance for payments comes in as an approach beyond other approaches to digital payments. Finally, the third phase is to empower people with actually access to the financial services that will allow them to uplift their lives, whether that's a loan, an insurance product, or an investment that gives them some level of returns or security in their old age through a pension. These financial products counterintuitively depend on data sharing without the ability to share information at low cost, in a tamper proof manner, through individual consent, you cannot systematically scale financial inclusion of products because at the end of the day, an institution offering a financial product has a cost of doing so and has a revenue return. And unless we build the digital public infrastructure rails that we call financial data sharing open finance, that element will never take off on the on the credit side. And we've seen the this is the key reason why many emerging economies around the world are actually choosing to build open finance rails to drive access to credit and other financial products. We actually believe that financial inclusion via open finance is not just important for an economic growth or second order economic effects perspective, but actually for financial stability, which is core to any regulator. First, it actually allows you to strengthen AML supervision, when you have fewer dark transactions or an informal economy, terror financing and money laundering is easier to monitor when your transactions are actually being logged in financial statements. Second, it allows you to have more effective monetary policy permeation through your society, if most of the credit that's going that's being utilized by people is actually coming from formal institutions, rather from informal institutions, but how once you decide that you really want open finance in your country, how do you build this in a manner that will actually drive scale and security in your ecosystem, we believe that it's a techno legal approach that's really critical. What do we mean by this, it means a combination of a regulatory framework, and the right technology standards and specifications without which you can't scale. Let's take an example first of the regulatory framework. In the space of payments, clearly identifying and demarcating roles of all the actors is a critical next step to be able to driving, allowing each of them to do what they do best, allowing regulators to regulate and innovators to innovate. Fintechs and new sort of smaller mobile wallets are coming into the space, flooding into the space. The question is how can we prescribe their role in a way where they focus on user interface innovation, and not so much on the movement of money where there are higher risks. And so we see often that both Brazil and India have actually crafted a separate license in Brazil, the PISP license, and in India, the TPAP third party application provider license in payments for fintech players that can actually just work on the user experience of money because they can be close to users, they can onboard users, without actually being involved in the movement of money. And then the wider roles of the payment rail operator are optional in countries, it can be done by the regulator, or it can be done by a secondary team within the regulator. When it comes to data sharing, there's a few licensed roles that should be made really clear. Financial information providers and users, what are their obligations, roles and responsibilities to make sure that data sharing happens in a regulated manner. And second, an optional ecosystem operator, which is a self or a self regulatory organization that can work to sort of advocate for the technology standards, as well as hold and update the technology standards as needed. In some countries, this role is performed by the regulator. In other countries, you have separate entities that can do this. But thinking through clearly what are the roles in this instance allows you that flexibility. Finally, this role of a consent manager is one that exists in the India ecosystem, and not in the Brazilian ecosystem as a separate role. But you can think through whether or not you'd like to introduce a role of an entity that takes consent for data flows, without actually being involved in the data flow itself. On the technology specification, these are really critical to introduce. Without the introduction of these specifications, it's like bringing a knife to a gunfight. You come in to try to control what banks and technology players are doing. If you simply write regulations without backing them up with technology specs, it becomes very difficult to enforce those regulations in practice. This means that in code, by building a payments protocol, that's modern QR specification that you put out on data sharing, having separate APIs for data flows, and for data formats, which can then change by sector, as well as a consent specification, you can enforce the good practices that you put out in your regulation through code. Finally, I'll stop here with this slide. We've done a brief case study comparing UPI and FIX, as well as the data sharing infrastructures in both countries of account aggregator and open finance. Please feel free to take a look to look at the technical deep dive of the differences between these two. But I'll close here for now and hand over to our esteemed speakers. Thank you. Thank you, Chandra. Thank you very much indeed. It was a comprehensive description, given the very short time you had. And now, please can I hand the virtual mic over to Dr. Rao, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. You have the floor. Thank you, Bill. I hope I'm audible to all of you. As a regulator, we look to frame and implement policies to minimize risk to the regulated entities and also ensure financial stability. At the same time, we also need to be open to innovations which can expand the remit of financial services in terms of scale, reach, and inclusion. And for this, I think technology plays a pivotal role as an enabler, which will make financial services more personalized, inclusive, accessible, and efficient. And open finance is the possible way ahead for this. Open finance is an extension of the concept of open banking. It empowers the customers who are the real data owners by giving them control over the financial data which is found in silos, so far available with the individual data holders and allow them to share it securely with authorized entities using third party consent based architecture so as to receive personalized and efficient financial services. So open finance has the potential to transform the financial landscape through finance as the lifestyle model, seamlessly integrating financial services into people's daily lives exactly when they need them with products and services that best meet their needs and receive the personal financial services they deserve. The thrust towards open financial finance initiatives in India started with the development of the digital public infrastructure. Today, it seeks to leverage on the interface of the three pillars of this, which is the identity, the payment, and the lending infrastructures, which have been or are in the process of being rolled out. The identification of the customer The identification of the customer begins with what we call the Jam Trinity, that is the Jandan account or the basic savings bank deposit account, which provides access to the formal financial services to the previously unbanked population. The Aadhaar card provides a digital identity to the Indian residents based on their biometric and demographic data, and a basic digital connectivity is ensured through affordable smartphones and internet connectivity. Together they have helped us in ensuring a revolution for underserved by enabling them to be part of the formal financial services. The payment infrastructure or the United Payments interface developed by our National Payments Council of India enables seamless digital payments that allow instant money transfer into multiple accounts using a mobile application or a QR code. This is now going to be complemented with the recently launched platform, which we have called as the Uniform Lending Interface, which is currently under trial on a pilot basis. This will enable frictionless disbursement of credit, bringing in efficiency into the lending ecosystem by reducing costs, ensuring speedy delivery and being scalable. This bouquet of DPI, that is the Jam, the UPI, and the ULI can be conceived of as the new trinity, which will revolutionize the formal financial landscape in India. The launch first took place of the UPI, which was followed by the account aggregator framework, which enables secure data sharing across financial institutions. The account aggregator framework has transformed data sharing by putting customers in control of their financial information with explicit consent as a requirement. And by maintaining control over their data privacy, customers can now decide who can access their data for what purpose and for how long. This approach empowers the individuals to share their financial information across, which is spread across various financial institutions with other financial entities to receive personalized services. Unlike traditional models for financial institutions held data in isolated silos, the account aggregator framework ensures that the data is securely shared and that too only for consented purpose. Another crucial regulatory feature of this framework is that while managing the consent of the customer and transferring data to the financial information user, the account aggregators do not store or access the data themselves. This design is intended at ensuring the misuse is minimized or sensitive financial information is not abused. And so there is a greater degree of data security and trust for the customer. This is also in line with the legal framework where we have the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which has been passed by the parliament, which recognizes the right of individuals to protect their data, and also the need to process the data for lawful purposes. I think two key features of this framework, which I thought I would highlight. One is its cross regulatory collaboration is involved in this process. The account aggregator framework not only has comprehensive coverage, spanning about 19 different types of financial information, but it also integrates with entities regulated by the various sectoral regulators, that is the Reserve Bank, the SEBI, the Insurance Regulation Development Authority and the Pension Fund Regulation Development Authority as well as the government departments. Second is a principle based approach to address the inclusion enables us to have this as an adaptive and flexible framework. So if you want to add in new systems into the new forms of asset types, they can be easily integrated into the account aggregator system. Recently, we included the goods and services tax network of India as a financial information provider, which now facilitates cash flow based lending to micro, small and medium enterprises. Having said that, I think there are a few challenges to which perhaps are need to be addressed to unlock the potential of this ecosystem. Now, one, we need an interoperable and inclusive account aggregator system. Some entities are reluctant to integrate with all account aggregators, given perhaps constraints in terms of bandwidth or the resources they have to spare. So that can actually impact the system's overall effectiveness and reach. So this reluctance poses a challenge and perhaps a fully interoperable and inclusive account aggregators ecosystem will perhaps be needed to ensure that this constraint is overcome. Then second is a lack of public awareness to the degree which is desirable. So despite the framework's potential, the public awareness is still a bit low. Increasing the understanding about the concept of consent and trust among the consumers is critical for widespread adoption. To address these issues, actually, we in the Reserve Bank have taken the responsibility of building awareness about the account aggregator framework through public awareness campaigns. Having said that, I think some key issues which need to be addressed. One is honoring the trust of the customer. Trust, once compromised, is exceptionally challenging to restore. And that is an example which all of us in the financial sector know very well. There have been rising concerns recently about frequency with which certain entities access data. So that raises the question of whether the data is being used strictly for the consented purpose or for some other purpose. It is essential that the financial information is accessed and used solely for the purposes which are explicitly authorized by the customer. This is not just a matter of compliance, it's about honoring the trust of the customer. Adhering to fair usage principles is crucial for protecting customer privacy and maintaining trust, which are fundamental to the long-term success and effectiveness of this account aggregator framework. Let me just conclude by saying that this inclusive open finance infrastructure has tremendous second-order impacts on the economy in terms of formalization, in terms of financial stability, effectiveness of monetary policy, Kamiya just mentioned, and also controlled innovation. While challenges remain, the increased participation in the account aggregator system coupled with Reserve Bank's commitment to facilitate the new trinity, I think, lays the foundation for a good future for the open finance in India. However, the success of this ambitious vision depends on several factors. First and foremost, it requires responsible engagement of the regulated entities, which will ensure that the framework operates with the integrity and transparency so that not only it meets but also exceeds its potential, which will drive a more inclusive, competitive, and innovative financial future in India. I will stop with that. Thank you very much. I'll hand it over back to Bill now. Thank you, Dr. Rao, for that very frank way in which you address some of the issues that you're facing, particularly on the account aggregation front. Thanks too for the three-letter acronym, JAM. I hadn't heard that before, but I will remember it. Okay, so next up we have Otavio de Massa, Deputy Governor of the Banco do Brasil. Otavio, the floor is yours. Okay, good morning, good afternoon, and good night for everyone that is attending this event. First, I want to thank the Cambridge Regulatory Innovation Hub for inviting me to be a part of this seminar. The innovation process we are witnessing now in Brazil is centering on efficiency. We are seeing massive investments in modern hardware and software aimed at efficiency and transforming banks' technological infrastructure to meet more modern and flexible standards, and developing products and services that are more attuned to what Brazilian consumers truly want and need. There is no doubt that the speed and intensity of this technological transformation in the Brazilian financial system are, in part, the result of the Central Bank of Brazil agenda deeply rooted in actions that promote innovation. Having said that, I would like to talk about five key points regarding this innovation process. First, the first aspect relates to the motivation behind the Central Bank's commitment to this innovation agenda. The answer is clear. Our greatest motivation is to force competition within the Brazilian financial system. The second aspect I would like to emphasize is actually more of a realization. There is no point in resisting or trying to block the process of innovation, especially when it comes to disruptive innovation. We are seeing this resistance to not avail across various economic sectors that try to fight change. When innovation is bound to happen, or when there are inefficiencies or high costs that can be addressed, the innovation process will inevitably take its course. Given this realization, I would like to bring up the third aspect, the importance of regulation being open to innovation process. This means being receptive to input from all stakeholders, whether regulated or not. The fourth aspect to highlight is that incumbents have also embraced this innovation agenda. They have adapted and transformed their legacy system to take advantage of the wave of increased openness, innovation, and competition. Incumbents quickly realized that resisting innovation and the entry of new players would be pointless, especially in jurisdictions like Brazil, where the Central Bank has been very open to this process from early on. The fifth and final aspect I will mention is that this process has been carried out with great responsibility, particularly concerning prudential and security aspects. The Open Finance ecosystem, which is now fully operational in Brazil, represents a transformative agenda. Official launch in 2020, Open Finance was developed by the market itself, but always under the Central Bank of Brazil's vigilant oversight. Currently, in relation to data sharing, there are more than 52 million total consents and more than 34 million consents given by unique individuals. Over the last weeks, the participating institutions have made more than 2 billion weekly API calls, which shows the size of the Open Finance ecosystem and how much it is being used. It is also important to mention that concerning our data and services scope, as well as the number of participating institutions, ours is one of the largest Open Finance ecosystems in the world nowadays. The Open Finance ecosystem refers not just to increased competition, but also to opening up a vast ocean of opportunities for innovation and efficiency, including internal process, customizing financial products and services to meet actual customer's needs, and increasing consumer conveniences. In this context, it is important to note that today all types of regulated institutions are developing products and services based on Open Finance. Some incumbents, for example, have more than 65 projects underway in various areas, all delivering the potential of Open Finance. Just to give a more concrete example of the impact of Open Finance in Brazil, participating institutions are reporting some benefits that they and their clients have received since the implementation of the system. One incumbent bank mentioned that because of the data sharing through Open Finance, it was able to increase client's credit limits on consumer direct credit in the amount of UShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxI-C9zHLbA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxI-C9zHLbA) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxI-C9zHLbA&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
 billion and on credit card limit in the amount of UShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxI-C9zHLbA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxI-C9zHLbA) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxI-C9zHLbA&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
20 million. Another incumbent bank said that it is originating more than US

I would like to highlight three key lessons learned from the implementation of Open Finance in Brazil. First, well-designed implementation plan. The first lesson is the need for a meticulous design implementation plan that addresses all relevant aspects and considers operational issues that might initially seem secondary. Once again, this underscores the importance of comprehensive planning. The second one is regulator engagement. The second lesson is the necessity of active involvement from the regulator in building this ecosystem. In my view, without close regulatory oversight, Open Finance would not materialize. Beyond technical issues, there are always divergent opinions on the path to take, which require almost continuous guidance from the regulator to achieve the objectives at hand. And the third one is the lack of resiliency. The regulators face constant questioning from all sides. On the one hand, there are critics who agree that Open Finance initiatives entail high costs, a lack of clear proposals, and a diversion of time and resources for existing products and services. On the other hand, supporters or challengers on this initiative are calling for even broader actions and faster process. I have no doubt that Open Finance will transform the Brazilian financial system in the coming years, even if customers and general public may not directly connect this transformation to the creation of the Open Finance infrastructure. In fact, that is one of the challenges of the initiative. Since it is an infrastructure rather than a specific product or service like PIX, our very successful fast payment system in Brazil, most financial customers won't even realize the value it's delivering. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Ottavio, for that again very frank account of some of the challenges you face, too. But also for the some of the astonishing statistics, the API volumes, for example, and the increase in lending, which one of your incumbent banks reported being able to do. And finally, I think probably one of the biggest lessons in terms of the involvement of control and guidance of the regulator, which probably contributed to the astonishing speed with which Brazil implemented open banking. So thank you. And we'll have some questions coming in for you thick and fast. So thank you. Finally, can I hand the mic to Yihuang, special advisor to the chief representative of the Bank for International Settlements. Yihuang, you have the virtual mic. Thank you very much for inviting me to join this such wonderful workshop and allow me to share my screen. So my name is Yihuang, a former academia and I just joined the BIS. So my talk will mainly try to be echo what Governor Rourke and Governor Dunlop and Shanty just mentioned. So more like, you know, some footnotes to try to understand how digital innovation happens to promote such as so-called financial inclusions. So slightly different in terms of presentation style, I would like to give some benchmark. I will start with a bottom-up approach rather than top-down approach in terms of open banking practice in Brazil and India. So firstly, let's look at the benchmark. So most of traditional banks follow, adopt this kind of a traditional business model, can now serve small business landings and provide financial inclusions service. So if you look at the United States, you look at left-hand panels, which is coming from the famous paper by Jeremy Stein. To look across times, there are permanent decline for US big banks, small banks, lending to small business. So we benchmark the most advanced capital market, financial market in the world, United States. So permanent decline for US banking service to the small business. So why? Because in theory, in front of a financial inclusion, we have some bearing. Number one, which open bank, open finance mainly providing information, data, sharings, information, bank account, accessibilities. More importantly, due to information asymmetry, moral hassle of a selection, we have country enforcement, we have more crucial things for a developing economy, so-called financial literacy. So today, my talk will follow the current practice in China, will mean as a benchmark to see, what's new, what we can learn from Brazil and India, both from top-down and bottom-up approach. In China, as we know, in the past 10 years, a lot of digital open financing provide financial inclusion, through payment, QR code payment I just mentioned, also consumer financing, SME lending, more importantly, investment inclusive, such as the worst products, through robot advisor, through all kinds of digital device innovations. So today, my talk, we mainly look at the advanced development in China as a benchmark to look at what we can learn for India and Brazil. So by recent work by my BI colleague, he can left-hand panel, one of the Chinese big tech company called All Financial, All Financial provide the finance service to a small business. If we look at it by my bank, the finance arm of our group, they provide more than 120 billion renminbi to more than 30,000 SMEs. Overall, in the right-hand panel, if you look at China, the total, in totals, the more than 3,600 billion renminbi provide this kind of small business lending to the small business and provide financial inclusions. Bottom line, we want to show what's new here. To summarize, we want to say, look, the experience from China, from India, and from Brazil is coming from the payment system. We start from digital payment innovation, then go through this kind of open financing platforms, finally provide the financial inclusions. If we look at the business models, a lot of big tech, private companies, such as e-commerce, social media, they run electronic platforms. This is a network that provides, besides the financial service, besides the e-commerce service, by products, they produce a lot of customer data. By pass, they accumulate, through payment system, accumulate a large stock of customer data. Through this data, payment system, they start to provide a lot of financial service, so-called open financing ecosystems. Overall, based on our BIS recent work, we use the three words to summarize the key business model. Through digital payment systems, we have data. Data goes through all the platforms, network, provide the financial services, activities, ecosystem, so-called DNA. That's the key business model for bottom-up approach in terms of digital finance, open banking, and provide financial service. So what's the performance? So based on my recent journal finance paper, I tried to show some performance in terms of how financial innovation through payment system is going to provide financial service to small businesses. So number one, why small businesses are very important for the economy, and why is it lack of financial service? Because number one, they don't have alternative financial source. They have a low-skill, open income source, no collateral, and sometimes no financial statements. Very hard to access credit through traditional financial institutions due to high credit risk. Secondly, most of them, you know, small business coming from a developing economy, sometimes, you know, the credit market is very segmented. Finally, they live in a rural, remote area in the mountains, you know, in islands, far away to financial service, so-called lack of financial inclusion. So can digital innovation help? The answer is yes. Digital finance innovation provides financial service use coming from open banking, open finance benefits, so-called information advantage. Then they use big data, machine learning, algorithm for finance service. Secondly, through the platforms and network, okay, online network, the distribution channel is very cheap, okay? Sometimes they provide financial service to the borrower without physical collateral, and sometimes they don't have a credit reference, credit score. And finally, why financial digital, you know, financial innovation, digital finance might have a low credit risk? Because of platform externality, two-side market, market exclusions. So based on my research in recent public general finance, we do find out the causalities from digital finance access and from growth. Literally after first month, you will see average sales of borrower, small business borrower from digital finance platforms increase more than 3.5 percent. Average transaction growth for credit access is more than 3 percent after first month. If we look at a more comprehensive way in terms of academic, you know, studies, you realize sales growth after credit access jump more than 30 percent, okay? And more importantly, so customers capital, customer attention, customer rating also increase after you accept digital finance credit, okay? Overall, what's new here? Through digital, you know, digital payment innovations, digital finance have a lot of new advantage compared to trading banks. Number one, information advantage. If you look at right-hand panels, you can see that we are not only observed from the lenders, the online SMEs, sales performance, service rating, personal characteristics, and more importantly, how to use credit, okay? They not only have information advantage, platform distribution channels, more important, also money in state platforms, and a very strong enforcement advantage. Based on recent discussion with Professor Ben Holmstrom, we try to compare what's new here, compare traditional banking service, traditional lending models based on collateral. Once a collateral, it goes to a financial institution borrows money. There's a trade-off between collateral values and information cost. However, if we have open bankings, open financing, digital innovation from payment systems, the cost of information almost comes to zero. Acquires information, stores information, verifies information, okay? So information replaces physical collateral, which is a new key in terms of digital finance lendings. Due to time constraint, let me just give my final remarks. So future finance coming from open finance, digital finance, it will be very inclusive, scalable, or sustainable because they rely on digital innovations to rely on more data, agreed data, and behavior data, account data. Then they use a platform distribution customer DNA models, combine what we call data-advantaged hot information, so credible software information from behavior data to try to build up this ecosystem with trust and reputation. And finally, we also need a global collaboration in terms of technology, infrastructures, and institutional infrastructures. And how do traditional banks and financial institutions collaborate with digital finance? That's what comes to today's topic. I learned a lot from Governor Rowe and Governor Damas' presentation, talking about the Indian experience and Brazilian experience. Open financing is the key. Based on our recent work by Augustine about Fintech, Finternet, and more importantly, how to provide incentive and how to reduce information costs will help us to provide better financial inclusions. And the platform not only has online, also offline integration. Finally, today my footnotes provide some experience both from top-down approach and bottom-up approach, and provide future in terms of digital finance data governance structures. And finally, let me thank you and looking forward to comments and the weekend. Thank you. And good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to the colleagues around the world. It is my great pleasure to say a few words as closing remarks for this very important and also very timely conference. Let me of course first join my BIS colleagues in thanking both the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance and the Center for Digital Public Infrastructure for co-hosting this event. And as you have heard from various speakers throughout the sessions, in the increasingly digital world, the issues of the open financing, particularly the data, are of paramount importance, both for individuals and for SMEs and also business. And against this backdrop, there is increased awareness that the open finance ecosystem can benefit financial system participants and society in general, in terms of the creating an environment in which the competitive advantages of different players can be used to provide people with better financial services. So, of course, the BIS, we work with our member central banks and other stakeholders, and including the RBI and the Central Bank of Brazil, which both governors have shared their experiences. We also try to explore some of these new dimensions through our innovation activities. One of the projects we are soon will launch, which is dealing with our cross-border open finance infrastructures. This is a joint project with many central banks. To my knowledge, RBI and Central Bank of Brazil also joined the project. So, I'm not, you know, this is, since this is the closing remarks, I'm not going to get into the details to the project. Instead, let me have a little bit of reflections on what I learned or what is my main takeaway out of today's discussions. So, firstly, in my view, there have been significant barriers to financial inclusions in most economies, but particularly in emerging markets. They emanate from societal attitude, legal framework, and higher transaction costs. You know, as the technology progressed, particularly in the last decade and a half, carefully designed DPIs, including open finance architectures, have emerged, which provide a potential way forward for countries to leapfrog traditional stages of development in this area. That's one takeaway. Secondary, in terms of the financial development, as my BIS colleague mentioned today, a collateral gap, because the large percentage of the world's populations, including the SME, small businesses, even if they do have bank accounts, but normally they cannot borrow funds because of the inadequate, tangible collateral. So that's a collateral gap. So data and activities collected by digital platforms in this regard, you know, can help to overcome these difficulties by bridging the gap and creating information as a new capital. Thirdly, we have heard how open finance can support financial stability. So the stability is one of the important dimensions for central banks. A open and efficient financial system can foster robust competition, encourage new entrants, and keep existing service providers nimble. So these are very good development, or encouraging development, that will promote continuous innovations within these financial industries and hopefully lower the cost for customers. Finally, I want to mention that while open finance offers quite a wide range of benefits, it also potentially poses significant risks and concerns. I think both governors mentioned it, particularly around the privacies and data security. And of course, as we all discussed, robust governance will remain essential. So that's pretty much the major takeaway I wanted to share at this moment. But before closing, let me take this opportunity to once again thank the CCAF and the CDBI for co-hosting this conference with us. And in particular, I would like to thank Nick Clark for giving such enlightening opening remarks, and Bill Robert for his excellent moderations of the panel discussions at the end, as well as, of course, Kamya Chandler for her thoughts on the global best practice in open finance technology architectures. And of course, my appreciation goes to all the speakers, Deputy Governors Rao and Deputy Governor Damaso for your insightful views and sharing of the lessons learned from your own countries. And of course, last, my thanks go to all the participants for tonight's conference. With that, let me close the conference. I wish you a pleasant weekend. And thank you. See you next time.








   20. Pix: DPI for Payment Transactions in Brazil | Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure

**Video Transcript:**
> I was at the beach, I bought the coconut and asked him, do you accept PIX? The seller said, yes, I accept PIX. So I made the payment for PIX and the coconut seller said, the guy who invented this PIX must be very rich. I don't know if it's that much. In 2020, Brazil's central bank introduced PIX, an instant payment system that revolutionized digital transactions. In just two years, PIX doubled the number of people using digital payments. This is their story. Since 2014, we have been signaling to the market the need for an instant payment system that could make transactions at low cost through smartphones, cell phones. But the market began to emerge with closed solutions and no open solutions. 77% of purchases were made in cash, which has a very high cost for the country. So the main goal was to stimulate the electronization of payments. We detected some problems in the payment industry in Brazil. One of them was the concentration of payment services in a few institutions, which generated a high cost of accessing the instruments and also a restriction on access. In 2019, we launched the Instant Payment Forum, where we were developing the market in a very participatory way. In February 2020, we launched the brand, which was inspired by the International Learning Lesson, where we saw that having a unique and strong brand of easy understanding was fundamental to the adoption of the population. In November, we fully launched PIX for the entire population. PIX, for both business and personal life, is an absurd advance. We are increasingly dependent on the technology of the phone. With the phone, we can do everything. I don't have a wallet, for example. For PIX to have this penetration and adoption so fast, we have a set of very important factors. First, I would say security. Since the beginning of the project, we have seen security as an essential factor. PIX has innovated not only in the user experience, but also with exclusive security mechanisms, giving this reliability to the population. The other was this part of the communication and engagement, which I talked about a little, which is being able to explain in a very accessible way to the entire population in a country of the size of Brazil, how you should use it, what forms, why it is important, why it makes it easier to have a PIX key, for example. If you have a small business, what forms can you implement? This communication, this educational process of the population, is also a factor of success. Participatory design, so you ensure that there are rules that cover the multiple needs. And also, always this concern with the user experience. And then, not only talking about the paying user, who will access it through his application, but also the receiving user, how he will offer the PIX to his clients. And we are always trying to give a lot of flexibility in this way. Another factor that I think is also very important for the adoption of PIX, especially when we are thinking about replacing the money, encouraging this electronization, is the cost. So, being able to provide it for free to the payers is also essential. It is a practicality for the entire population. I really like working with PIX too. It's better because the money is disappearing, so the person pays the PIX, it's safer, and we have improved a lot with PIX. It goes straight to the account and there is no fee. PIX is basically a public policy. And if we look at the cost of this policy for the Central Bank, which is basically the public sector, and the impact it has on society, on ordinary people, on small businesses, we will see that it is one of the most efficient public policies that Brazil has introduced in recent decades. The cost of having a system like this, the cost of having an instantaneous payment system, a public system, an open platform, is minimal in relation to its impact on society, especially in economies where there is a high degree of informality. More than 71 million Brazilians who, before the launch of PIX, did not use electronic transactions, are now PIX users. This is a very expressive number. We believe that if the Central Bank, in the Brazilian context, had not taken this leadership, the industry itself would hardly be able to organize itself. There is a question of neutrality in public interest. PIX is a neutral platform. It allows equal access in equal conditions. From a large financial institution to a fintech that is entering the market, which has an innovative business model, but perhaps more niche, to a credit cooperative that serves a niche of people. This is what allowed the democratization of PIX operations. We were able to practically double the number of digital payment transactions after the introduction of PIX. And also competitive pressure on traditional instruments. After PIX came into operation, we saw that several other instruments had to be modernized, otherwise they would be increasingly outdated. Since its launch in 2020, PIX has reached 86% of Brazil's adult population. 40% of them made a digital payment for the first time and banking penetration grew from 60% to 75%, bringing more than 40 million people into the formal financial system. Yet, a unified payments ecosystem is just the tip of the iceberg of a broader transformation in Brazil. When we talk about digital transformation in general, it is not just a transformation based on technology, but it is a transformation that goes through people. It goes through a change of mentality, a search for a digital mentality, in the sense that it is not just about the use of technology itself, but about the understanding of the value that the use of those technologies can bring to the service and to people's lives. We are currently making a big change in the Brazilian identification system. We are implementing a new model of identity, a new physical document. It is very important to stress that this model brings a combination of our physical identity document with our digital document, with our digital identity, which is the GovBR account. This is the biggest difficulty in digital transformation in most countries, the integration of databases. You can pull the information from all databases to leverage their use, both from a social and economic development point of view. If you have potentially integrable data, you also generate opportunities, and the State becomes not only reactive, but also proactive in relation to the benefits of citizens. The same goes for the economic area. Credit concessions, support for micro-entrepreneurs. If the data is part of an integration, naturally respecting the privacy issues, you are able to offer a much greater set of services to citizens. You follow the person's life cycle throughout their life, and the government services are there, which they need to have access to at that moment. Over 154 million accounts have been created on the Gov.br site, which now integrates 4,400 digital services and 13.4 million digital signatures. By making nearly 1,000 services interoperable, this initiative has facilitated over 800 million transactions and saved the Brazilian economy a total of $740 million. The principles that we will try to internalize in this process are free software, interoperability, modularity, connectivity, simplicity and transparency. Without this, you can't do it. Even in a country of a continental scale, with many challenges, many complexities, and a very diverse population, we need to have this capacity for dialogue, for openness, for understanding people, precisely so that we can deliver better services with greater quality and greater effectiveness for them. Brazil is using digital public infrastructure to leapfrog progress on a massive scale. By combining cutting-edge technology, transparent and participatory governance, and dynamic public and private innovation. Because a digital economy is inevitable, but an inclusive one requires governments to take action.

   23. Bringing Data Sharing at Scale to Life – 1 | Amit Ranjan (Ex-Architect of Digilocker) | Masterclass

**Video Transcript:**
> I was one of the founders for SlideShare and SlideShare was acquired by LinkedIn in 2012 and I continued working there for a couple of years and in 2014 was when I was exiting SlideShare and LinkedIn and it so happened that I had always been connected with the product ecosystem in India, having volunteered for many industry bodies like NASSCOM, like iSpirit, and it was through their connection that they wanted some help with specifically iSpirit. I was a volunteer with iSpirit right from their inception and they wanted some help with a government consultation, so because I had some free time with me, so I was helping them out. I went and visited the Ministry of Electronics and IT and that was my first brush with the government actually and that was also when I believe the government got to know about me and my background for the first time. So Aadhaar happened in 2008 or 2009 and by 2014 or 15, there were already close to 60 to 70 crore Aadhaar cards or Aadhaar numbers that have been issued. So Aadhaar was in the bag in that sense and the government of the day was kind of considering that now that we have Aadhaar and one of the key things about Aadhaar is that Aadhaar is built as an API and the whole concept and the purpose of making it an API is that you can build things on top of it, things that leverage and use Aadhaar's API capabilities. So the government was in a broad sense thinking what are the other products and services that a citizen could actually utilize in their daily lives and they were thinking about something in the payment space, they were thinking something about in the data space. So that was the juncture when I joined. I think they had some very brief and sketchy ideas about something in the document and the data space, but specifically DigiLocker hadn't taken shape at that point in time. What DigiLocker does essentially, if you think of it, it is a key citizen pain point. We are all used to this, we all have various documents, certificates, mark sheets and IDs that are issued by the government or some agency of the government over our lifetime and we tend to use them in a repetitive manner. We take photographies and then we submit it. So we are all familiar with that ecosystem and the problems associated with it. Now given the fact that the internet had happened by then, Adhaar's capabilities were well known by that time. So I think you can add one and one together and say, okay, what is it that we can now build using the existing technological capabilities to solve a particular citizen pain point. And in this case, the pain point being this repetitive use of papers and certificates and IDs, which is so slow, bureaucratic, it causes wastage. You can imagine it leads to delays. So if there was a digital way of solving that problem, that is what the government was thinking in terms of the DigiLocker plan. DigiLocker, I think one of the easiest ways to think of it, I think the idea is borrowed or similar to what a Dropbox or a Google Drive is, with one difference that in a Dropbox or a Google Drive, you essentially upload your own documents. So you are the master of what you upload and any authenticity of those documents comes essentially from what you intend it to be. DigiLocker is kind of slightly different and that's where the real power comes in. The documents are essentially coming from their respective government sources. So like for example, our school certificates and our mark sheets are issued by the state education boards. The PAN database, the PAN number that we have is issued by CBDT. Our passport is issued by the Ministry of External Affairs. So what happens is that with each of these data records or IDs, they have been issued by some wing or some department or something which comes from the government side. So what DigiLocker does is that it's built a central thin application, it's a thin layer which is talking in turn to each of these individual data sources and the citizen can actually fetch their citizen records via the DigiLocker platform. But DigiLocker does not copy that data. So that is a very key architectural design decision is that DigiLocker does not have the data itself, DigiLocker does not copy the data. DigiLocker technically, it's what you would call a consent manager and consent managers are only about managing the data exchange. They cannot look at the data, they cannot manipulate the data, they cannot change the data. So the whole idea is that these documents or these data records that are being aggregated on the platform, they have to be used in a certain workflow or a certain use case as part of maybe a government process. So on one hand, you have the issuers of these records, like as I said, the education boards or let's say the CVDT or the MEA or could be the driving license, which is issued by Ministry of Transport. So they are the data issuers in the system and then there are the data users or the data consumers. So for example, if I as a citizen, I'm driving on the road and the cop stops me and says, hey, can you show me your driving license? So the driving license is being asked for by the cop on location. So they are a data consumer and what DigiLocker enables is that I can, instead of showing my physical driving license, I can actually take out my mobile app, whip out the DigiLocker app, and from there I can show the digital record for the driving license to the cop. And there's a whole legal system and a legal structure that has been built around it because you can build an application, but how do you ensure that it is recognized as a legally verifiable credential? It is something that the courts will agree to. It is something that the cop on the street, when he or she is shown this particular document, how do you ensure that they are going to believe that this is the authentic thing? So that is the whole power of DigiLocker is that if it's coming from DigiLocker, it has to be secure, it has to be original, it has to be authentic because DigiLocker is directly talking to the source databases and it is enabling the data exchange for the data consumers. It's verifiable because that's the whole point of DigiLocker is that if it's on DigiLocker, it is verified as coming from the original source of truth, which means it is credible, it is validated and you don't need to revalidate that, that is this the right record. If it is on DigiLocker, it is verified. Coming from the background of startups working in the government is that a lot of what we build and it's very easy to think of the primary users coming from a background where they can just do it themselves. It's a DIY use scale or it's a self use case, but if you go to the villages, if you go to the semi-urban areas, if you go to absolutely remote upcountry areas, a lot of people there don't have the access or the means to access that or even if they let's say had a mobile phone, they may not know how to navigate through the app stores, download it, verify it. So the government often what they do in these situations is that there is an assisted mode of delivery. For example, in the rural areas, the government has something called the CSC centers and the CSC centers, somebody who's living in the villages can actually go to the CSC center and help and they will be helped in setting up their DigiLocker account and if they want to kind of take out a printout or show that document to somebody, they can do it via the CSC center. So there are different modes of operation here. There is the self-serve mode, there is the DIY mode and there is the assisted mode. QR codes have become ubiquitous now, especially after UPI, where it's become very common for people and people understand now that QR codes are a way of verifying the authenticity. Similarly, the same concept has been used in DigiLocker, wherein the certificates have a QR code and if you wanted to verify that, okay, is this certificate genuine, then the QR code can be read by the QR reader in the app itself and that kind of validates that this is the original. Multiple ways in which we approach the design of the system. So I think the first and foremost is that building something from the government at population scale. So concerns like privacy, security and consent is at the heart of the system. I would use the word consent is something which is key here because DigiLocker also, as I said, essentially is a consent manager. And the government of India has a very important framework called the consent framework. So DigiLocker follows the consent framework. And in a broader sense, there is something called the DEPA, which is the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture. So DigiLocker is kind of part and parcel of the DEPA framework. And essentially what the consent framework essentially says is that the data belongs to the citizens and the data is available in DigiLocker only and only if the citizen kind of wants it and the citizen wants to share it with a respective data consumer. So it is not possible to access anybody's data unless and until the citizen is in the center of that flow and the loop and they authorize and they consent to it and they say that, okay, I allow my data coming from this source to be used by this source. And you can specify for so much time and so much, so the multiple things they can be specified like. So I would say that is probably one of the first things that consent is at the heart of the system. I think in terms of DPI, most systems are built on open standards. There is extensive use of open source, open APIs are a big part of the DPI architecture and the framework. And you must understand that governments by definition are built in silos and that is by design. So data by design is fragmented, it is siloed, the left arm and the right arm do not talk to each other. So in many ways, one of the real challenges that we faced building something like DigiLocker is that in a situation where the design itself is of data fragmentation, how do you build some kind of an aggregation layer? And that is only by ensuring that the product and the platform, it kind of completely takes care of data, security, privacy, consent to the highest order and the highest level. Building something of this magnitude, of this scale cannot be done without overcoming the challenges. I think the first thing that comes to my mind is that, so this is kind of, and especially when going back to 2014-15, this was a futuristic idea, futuristic concept. It was an unproven concept. And so one of the things that you see happening is that, so there is this dichotomy between where are the legal provisions, where is the law, and what is the technology kind of trying to achieve? And is it allowed by law? And what has happened is that technology is kind of galloping at its own pace. It is keeping far ahead of law. So that I think kind of turns out to be a real challenge, is that you are building something at a very fast pace. And at a time, technology does tend to be slightly ahead of the law. But you know, once you kind of have something, you need to dial back and make sure that it conforms to whatever the legal provisions are. So I think that is something that comes up frequently when you are building these kind of API, DPI platforms, is that not everything may be kind of streamlined as far as the legal provisions are concerned on the day you start building it. There is a process of iterative understanding and incremental development that is happening. And soon they kind of catch up and they are in sync with each other. So I would say that is one of the key things that challenges that we faced. Right, I think, you know, across the world, digitization is something which has picked up space, both on the private side, as well as the government or the public side. And what my personal experience with DigiLocker has been that the use case for DigiLocker is pretty like, pretty, it's at the least common denominator level. You can pick up any country and they would have some kind of system whereby there is a digital, you know, version of the school certificates and mark sheets or driving licenses or their tax IDs. So every country probably has the need for a basic fundamental level data and document platform. So that is something that we have seen all across. What the beauty of India's stack is that it kind of gives you a complete architecture and a framework for any country that really wants to kind of, you know, build a digital stack over its citizen services, then how do you kind of go about doing it? You start off with some kind of a digital ID, then you can actually link that digital ID to something like a data platform, then you can maybe, you know, have a payment related system that is kind of built on top of it. So, and the whole value of the stack kind of, you know, increases exponentially once you have these various platforms working in conjunction with one another. I mean, you can look at the platforms in isolation, but the real power of the stack is when you actually kind of put them together and then you can see that the value actually expands exponentially.

**Video Transcript:**
> The entire DPI story is like a story of digital transformation for India. And DigiLocker as a DPI was part of the bouquet of the services that Ministry of Electronics and IT was working along with the other stakeholders in order to ensure more efficient public services to citizens, in order to ensure, reduce the hardship that people face, in order to reduce the dependence on paper for most documents and certificates that people need, and in order to ensure that documents can be easily accessed and verified by whosoever we need it. I, of course, happened to get into this role because of my assignment. We are civil servants. The government posted me as the head of National E-Governance Division, Digital India Corporation, which was at the forefront of implementing this project. And this was, of course, probably based on my earlier experience also having worked in this ministry in 2009-12 as a Deputy Secretary and Director for E-Governance. See, like one of the most difficult things that people find, especially when they are accessing public services, is number one, to prove who they are, to prove where they stay. So, if suppose you are wanting admission for a child in a school, in nursery, the school will immediately want you for a birth certificate. Birth certificate is issued by a public authority. So, you go there, you either queue up in that office or you fill up an online form, get the birth certificate, either a paper certificate or a PDF certificate. Then for the school admission portal, you go to the Education Ministry or the private school, public school, whichever website. Then you apply, even if you are applying online, you have to upload a PDF also. So, effectively what is happening is that a citizen, both the two services, the issuance of a certificate and the need for accessing a certificate, both are required by a government entity or an authority. But in effect, rather than the two systems talking to each other, we are reducing the citizen to act as a courier between the two systems to apply, get a certificate from one authority and go and submit to another authority. And this whole reliance of documents, and then very often most public authorities would want to submit documents in triplicate, sometimes they will want it to be attested by a Gazette Officer. So, ultimately the citizen spends a lot of time and energy in moving from one office to the other office, collecting all kinds of documents, getting it attested, verified, submitted. And even if a document is attested, the department or the office which is accepting it does not even know that it is attested by a genuine officer or something. So, a lot of forgery, a lot of fake documents will start coming in. So, it was felt that if we have to enable ease of living for citizens and ease of doing business for businesses, we will have to solve this problem. So, how do we ensure that documents are issued electronically, documents are issued are accessed electronically and any third party who wants to verify a document can they verify electronically. So, this was the premise on which the DigiLocker was built. And the architecture is very simple, the issuer gives their APIs to DigiLocker, so that DigiLocker can access the documents. And any verifier, when they want to verify a document, whether what he is submitting is correct or not, then he makes a query, consent is given by the owner of the document and then the access is provided for API based verification of documents. So, whether it is academic documents, whether driving licenses, whether it is Aadhaar document, whether income tax papers or health records, all have become part of this entire ecosystem, which enables paperless governance and which enables electronic authentication verification of documents by all stakeholders. It results in benefit to the citizens, it results in benefit for the issuers, they do not need to print paper documents and most importantly it results in benefit for the end users who want to verify, who want to authenticate any document that has been issued through this system. The most important component when it was designed and it was architected was number one, there was no intent or there is no feature for storing documents centrally. It was built on a federated architecture approach, wherein documents will ultimately reside on the issuer of the document. So for example, if CBSE is issuing class 10th and class 12th certificates, it is accessible on DigiLocker, but this does not mean that all the certificates are coming to a central database or central data center or central repository, the certificates do not come there. We only get access through APIs of the documents and we pull it and make it available to the user of the document. Similarly for driving licenses, similarly for Aadhaar, similarly for PAN card, similarly for all records which are part of that. And similarly when verification happens, the consent framework for DigiLocker was notified by MIT way back in 2015 and based on that, any verifier, anyone who wants to verify the document can kind of access it through APIs and do the verification. So actual document is not flowing into a central repository or going to a verifier. Only the verification is happening electronically, which ensures in a very secure, very simple design. And the second part what has happened is that, like over and above, like as we move forward, very often people wanted like kind of an offline verification also. So what we did was that we introduced a QR code in each document. So QR code can be scanned by the QR code scanner on the DigiLocker app and the authenticity of the document is proved. So for example, when you are going to the airport and you do not have your paper ID document and the CISF person at the airport wants you to show your ID, then you can show your DigiLocker ID on the DigiLocker app. But that also, he can also scan the QR code and verify it from the server. So that way the design was made to ensure that it results in ease of use by the users, ease of verification and it works that way. And the third thing that DigiLocker also did was that it exposed the APIs, the verification APIs to various users. So for the entire ecosystem of users, what we call as a DigiLocker partners, there are FinTech companies, there are mutual fund companies who are kind of doing their KYC by using the DigiLocker credentials. So when they have to onboard users and they want to verify the identity of a user, they do it through the DigiLocker APIs. So that results in their cost, the cost of KYC coming down, the ease of onboarding users is there and the numbers go up. For example, Zaroda CEO has been on record, Nitin Kamath, saying that how earlier it used to take a lot of time to acquire a customer, a cost and the time taken. And very often if you have to open a DMAT account, you would require to sign maybe 40 places you have to sign on paper documents. But with DigiLocker, the KYC thing became very easy. You could do a Aadhaar based KYC through the DigiLocker and then onboarding of users became easy. The cost of acquiring a customer came down drastically. The time taken to onboard a user came down drastically and resulted in a lot of benefits. In fact, most of the FinTech unicorns today, of course, they are providing a lot of services also. But part of the reason for they becoming unicorns and they acquiring more users and they providing the services also is because of the ease of adding customers that happens with the DigiLocker APIs. Similarly, there have been other uses. For example, everyone would have used DigiYatra. That also works on a very simple DigiLocker based API verification that happens. So the simple design and architecture ensured that it was easy for people to use and it was also easy for application developers to integrate DigiLocker APIs in their system and design. And that is why even though it may appear that it is not very popular as like UPI, but UPI today has maybe around 300 million users and DigiLocker has 280 million users. So we are not too far behind. Yes, that is what that is the beauty of the verifiable credentials. What happens is that most people are not very literate. They will not be able to decipher and you need documents in various languages and all. But QR code is something which cannot be fudged. QR code is something wherein it pulls the information directly from the server. So when we did the COVID vaccination certificates, there also the verifiable credentials approach was used and it was done on a standard which is becoming a global standard for the verifiable credentials. So if I have my certificates, if I have the QR code on my certificate, it could be verified by any entity whether in India or anywhere in the world. So that is what is now going to come in the academic documents also. So it does not matter whether you are an urban citizen or a rural citizen, a student from a village or a student from a public school in the city, all of you will get the same academic credentials, the same QR code, QR code with a similar QR code, which can be scanned by the DigiLocker scanner and verified. And now with the academic bank of credits and APAR ID coming in, wherein all academic credentials, even your semester mark sheets of colleges, universities becoming a part of the National Academic Depository on the DigiLocker. These documents can be verified by universities and by employers to give you jobs. So that all the time that was taken earlier for verifying your credentials, you are verifying your transcripts, that is going to reduce a lot. And what I feel is that going forward, this will become the universal global standard and other countries will also like to build something like this. Already there has been talk of Apple decided to introduce Apple Wallet in California and became big news and they were wanting to introduce driving licenses on that when we had been doing this for the last six years or so. So other countries are also looking at it. There are a lot of advantages to that. It is climate friendly because you reduce paper and it also results in a lot of benefits to users, to stakeholders, to authenticators, to everyone. Multiple challenges because to convince partners to join the DigiLocker ecosystem has been a huge, huge challenge. Per se, the technology is very simple. APIs are used in almost every application today. So the simple technology is very simple, but the effort required to onboard users and the effort required to get ministries and departments issue orders and notifications saying that DigiLocker documents are as authentic as paper-based documents. That was a major effort. So like we started with that for identity, it became like banking. RBI issued guidelines which said that KYC documents coming from DigiLocker can be used for opening bank accounts. The CB also came up with that, that could be used for opening DMAT accounts. Railways came with an order which says that these documents can be used for verifying people to travel in trains. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said that a driving license on a DigiLocker is as authentic as a paper driving license. And then a host of institutions have issued such orders which has made DigiLocker get legal sanctity. And then the effort that the team does, our team which works on that, one part is the technology team and one part is the partnerships team. So the partnerships team works with various boards. For example, school boards. There are 28 to 29 school boards across the country. To convince each one of them to bring their certificates on this was a huge, huge effort. Then once they saw the value in that, they became onboarded. So for the universities, for example, when we are building the academic bank of credits and the APAR IDs, we are working with all the thousand plus universities across the country to get them to get onboarded on them, to get them to give their APIs here, to get them to agree to issue their certificates, mark sheets through this. It had been a huge effort. In fact, some universities thought that they will, because very often when they give the copies of degrees or when they give transcripts, they charge money for that. So they started feeling that they will lose a revenue stream. Then we had to convince that the benefits will far outweigh what you will lose. And Department of Higher Education also chipped in and said that like once you get onboarded, whatever revenue loss you will have in giving paper certificates will compensate you. In National Health Authority, when they are building the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, when the health records, the electronic health records came in, they have said that there can be several health lockers where electronic health records can be stored. But DigiLocker was the first port of call. And today, I think DigiLocker is the only robust health locker that is existing in the ABDM ecosystem, where in electronic health records, your blood reports, your X-ray reports, your MRI reports, your CT scan reports, all can be stored on the DigiLocker in an electronic format. And if you want to take a second opinion from some doctor and want to share those documents, you can digitally share with documents of any hospital with any hospital. So that's again something that's very, very kind of transformational. And bringing all these partners and onboarding them and getting government orders issued with regard to the legal sanctity of the whole document, the DigiLocker ecosystem has been, I would say, maybe the more important part, rather than just building the technology part of it. Globally, more and more countries are planning to adopt. And one use case that I feel and I hope will be done is that the entire passport visa system can get integrated on a DigiLocker kind of system. Because like every country, when you are giving a visa to a visitor from some other country, the one thing that you want to verify is that he has a genuine passport and you have know the identity of that. So if the entire passport visa ecosystem globally starts following common standards and all countries start using that, then if it comes on a DigiLocker ecosystem, then it has great value and if it's integrated with the VFS and the BLI systems which issue the passports and with the visas, then you maybe when you are applying for a visa, you will not need to physically give your passports in an embassy. So that kind of thing will be very, very transformational. Similarly, academic certificates. Academic certificates are something which everybody needs. There is a lot of mobility in the education space. People go from India to study in the United States. People go from all parts of countries to study all over the world. So everywhere you need to verify the transcripts. So if this becomes like a global standard, verification of academic credentials across the world will become very, very easy. Similarly, for employment, people have the work experience, educational qualifications, that becomes the basis for applying for a job. So if your academic credentials or if your work experience is verified digitally, then getting these jobs will become very, very easy. Then the entire space of business, for example, smart contracts, for example, agreements, documents, various kinds of MOUs, agreements that people share, if all of it becomes part of this ecosystem, verifying them, authenticating them becomes very, very easy. And further, the work that we are doing along with CBSE and the educational ecosystem along with the DigiLocker team is bringing all these certificates on a blockchain-based architecture so that the authenticity of the document with regard to it being tamper-proof, it being authentic is also further ensured. So all this I feel that in the next three to five years, this will evolve greatly. The system will become much more secure than what it is now. System will become much more replicable. There are already several countries who have shown interest in replicating a DigiLocker kind of system in their own countries, including countries like the United Kingdom. And I will feel that once this becomes more ubiquitous, once countries start using it for their own domestic needs to begin with, the next step will be to build up a document cloud across the world and all documents which are required for international travel, that will also become part of this ecosystem and will result in a lot of benefit for the economy of the world for businesses to do their transactions seamlessly without the need of any paper. That's why DigiLocker follows the best of the security standards. I believe it's ISO 27001 to which it confirms. And even though we are not storing data of citizens as issued from the publishers at a central repository, still the API-based transactions are happening. So data does travel when the API-based access is done. So that is also done in an encrypted format, that's done in a fully secure format, so that if there is an attack or if there is somebody who is trying to meddle into the APIs and trying to steal data from that, that is also prevented. So that kind of system, that kind of architecture, that kind of security design has been built in, which ensures that all the data that remains on the DigiLocker ecosystem is 100% secure without any issue. Regular audits are done, regular security checks are done in order to ensure there are no patches which are left behind. Sometimes our own teams are subject to try to do a hackathon or try to do a cyberstorm in order to say that what if some attack happens, what if something goes wrong, how do we ensure that we are secure. So all those things are part of our regular business practice, which to keep the DigiLocker data and information fully secure. There is another aspect to DigiLocker that apart from the data, that information that is issued by issuers, the authentic document, DigiLocker also provides 1 GB of space to all users, wherein one can store my personal documents also. So there also a lot of security is ensured that if I am keeping my personal documents under the DigiLocker, those cannot of course be verified because they are my own personal documents that I am uploading. But still it kind of allows you a document wallet so that I can carry my personal document like a drive anywhere. But there also 100% security is ensured that that data that I also upload is kept very secure and is like any attack that happens can be registered or can be checked and can be ensured that 100% security and privacy of data is ensured. See something similar would not be needed. What we need to do is that a startups and all we have almost 2000 partners who are there who are building applications on top of DigiLocker because what DigiLocker has brought is like all important documents about the citizens life cycle available on one space. So there is a lot of value in building applications in the financial space, in the health space on top of DigiLocker. And last year in fact the EntityLocker also introduced wherein not only users but companies, organizations, trusts, not for profits also can open a DigiLocker account wherein they can keep their documents relating to their tax returns relating to their company filings on a DigiLocker ecosystem. The businesses also have a lot to gain. So I would say that any startup or any business who is trying to build a public service they can easily access the DigiLocker APIs, use it for the KYC, use it for verifying information on that which is available on the DigiLocker ecosystem, build applications on top of it, offer value added services and they will create a lot of value with this. There are a lot of countries who are looking at it, Sri Lanka is looking at it, Mauritius is looking at it, United Kingdom is looking at it, the United States have had a look at it. So we are sharing them the experience that we have had both from the technology point of view and both on the effort that has been required to build the ecosystem around DigiLocker. So that is what we engage as part of the DPI diplomacy that is going on. The global DPI repository, DigiLocker is an important component of the global DPI repository and we have signed MOUs also with nine countries. So it is a work in progress wherein the insights with regard to building a system like DigiLocker is being shared with the international community for those who want to learn, replicate and build something similar to DigiLocker.

   26. DPI Masterclass – Digital Health at Population Scale

**Video Transcript:**
> Next speaker is Mr. Kiran, he is the advisor to the National Health Authority and he will be talking to us about building DPI from a healthcare perspective. Good afternoon everybody, always very hard to do a session just after lunch. So I have been given the hard task of trying to keep you guys awake, interested in probably what's a, it's not a very boring topic but it's a pretty interesting topic. So I think all morning you probably heard about digital IDs, payments, you know all of you are familiar with, if you are here you are familiar with the word Digital Public Infrastructure. So the question, and I am going to start with the question, do you guys really believe that health requires DPIs? Do you think, anybody, so what kind of a DPI could we think of for health? And anyway what would our objective be? But to do what? I mean, what are we trying to really think what we should do in, so for an ID you could say it's for identification for the purpose of say a KYC or whatever, right, or for benefits, for payments we are talking typically about easing movement and flow of money. What do you think we should be doing in health? Anything, any, is there one problem, anybody thinks there is a problem to be solved here or you know we definitely don't want to do DPIs for DPI's sake. In terms of physical services, is there a passive interface available amongst medical logistics? Sure. So in how many of your countries can you say that any patient has access to all of their health information across all of their providers that they go to? Is it a problem? Is it a problem that you visit multiple healthcare providers but you are not able to get the data in one place for you as a patient in almost all of your countries? Same problem in India, so we are no different, right? So that is one of the problems I think we want to take up. Now as public policy makers and public health policy makers, do you think you would want to get access to what's going on in terms of information or information patterns in health across various parts of the country and how would you actually get access to that data, right? So those are the kind of problems that we are really trying to solve in healthcare. So in India, there is an actually a national mission, it was initially called the National Digital Health Mission and it was renamed to the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. So what I'm going to try to do is over the next 30 minutes, I'm just going to try to give you like a high level overview, we are not going to get into too much details unless somebody is very interested in terms of how it actually attempts to solve the problem and then you can then look at it and see how much of it is applicable to your own country. So before we dive into the digital mission itself, let's take a quick look at how healthcare actually gets delivered in India. India, as you guys know, already know, all the numbers in India are very, very large. So you know, we are the country of large numbers. So up on the top, you'll see we have almost 200,000 healthcare facilities in India across hospitals, diagnostic centers, clinics and so on. And in general, when we started looking at digital health, the most important thing is how digitized are these healthcare facilities, who supplies software to them, what kind of software is in use at these healthcare facilities because any digital data is of course being developed on some piece of software that's being used at these facilities. So when we did that exercise, we found that there are more than 2000 companies in India which are making software. So by the way, if I were to go to the US and ask this question, what do you think the answer will be? What do you think will the answer be for the number of people who make software for health facilities there? Yeah, it's actually, interestingly, three companies in the US have more than close to 60 plus market share, 60% plus market share. And we couldn't find one company in India with a 1% market share. So it's very fragmented, highly fragmented in terms of how actually software and care providers are provisioned. Usually the software that's used at a health facility, it has its, you know, like all technology people in this room, we love acronyms, so the health acronyms, you have software, so they're typically called health information systems, laboratory information systems and so on. And of course, the government runs software for all its public health programs. So India has a humongous number of public health programs. I'm sure even many of the countries have public health programs with public health workers using specific software. So for example, during COVID, when we had vaccination in India, we had a digital public good infrastructure that's called COVIN, which kept records of all the people who got vaccinated digitally. So similarly, there's a whole bunch of software. You see those acronyms, the RCH actually is for mother and child based software, NCDs is for the things like diabetes and hypertension and so on. So there's also a whole bunch of software with health information that the government owns and kind of operates. And the reality in India is most of us Indians tend to use both a mix of public and private health care. So I think almost all of us who live in India, I got my vaccinations from a government facility. My dad was in the hospital just last week. We were at a private health care facility. And the reality is, and we also use like small clinics, big corporate hospitals, public systems no data moves across any of these, right? So that's the reality of how things work in India. And so if you really look at what's the mix, private health care actually dominates in India, whether it's urban or rural. So almost 79 and 72% of the people tend to seek health care in private facilities and only a little bit in public. So when we set out to look at, we started asking the question, you know, how can this idea of DPIs really be applied to health care? So I'm going to actually jump to the solution and then I'm going to go back first. And so like I said, before I go there, this is now a national initiative. So that means there is a department that's been identified in the government. There's a budget behind it. There's a lot of clarity about what the government has to do and who's responsible for running these digital public infrastructure and helping create a health, digital health ecosystem around the digital public infrastructure. I think you would have talked about, for example, for finance, how the NPCI does that for UPI, how UIDI does that for the identity system in India or other. The National Health Authority is the one that does the digital public infrastructure for health in India. And what does it do? It essentially has three big digital public goods that we have identified. The very first one is called a Health Information Exchange and Consent Manager. It's called a HICM. And its primary role is three things. The first is it's expected to help everybody get access and build their own personal health records, irrespective of which health care provider they go to. So that's number one. Number two, it's supposed to provide a certain set of data. Completely, these are all aggregate data sets. So there is no personal information in it, which helps them do disease surveillance and interesting information for public health management. So classic example is COVID. You really couldn't manage COVID if you couldn't tell where there is a positive test case happening, how many cases were coming in different areas, and so on. So this is the kind of public health data that's quite important. And the last bit is where we are trying to create anonymized data sets that can be very useful for AI. So that's the first digital public good. The second digital public infrastructure is to do with health insurance. So this one just looks at how do you move information, digital information, between a provider and a payer, if there are scenarios where there are payers. So in India, interestingly, unlike many, I don't know how it is in various countries, but most countries will usually cover both inpatient care and outpatient care through insurance, if they have an insurance scheme. India, almost all insurance schemes are only for inpatient care. Outpatient care is typically out of pocket. So people pay cash when they're doing outpatient care. And they'll usually have a claim when they have an inpatient episode in India. But this digital public good is for optimizing and standardizing that interchange so that providers can get money and can actually track how much money they have to get. And the last digital public good is for digital health services. So think about if you want to book an appointment with a doctor, is it going to be a standard experience across all health care providers, or it's going to vary? How do you do teleconsultation? So for example, in India, and in most cases, teleconsultation required both the doctor and the patient to use the same software provider. So that's how they were achieving it. In India, we have actually tried to make sure that doctors can use any software they want, patients can use any software they want. If they are UHI, as we call it, UHI compliant, it's interoperable, you can actually do a full telemedicine consultation, which actually means you can find a doctor, you can book an appointment when they're free, you can make a payment that the doctor wants, you can exchange health records, you can do the video consultation, and you can get your prescription back. All of this completely interoperably using this interaction. So those are the three big digital public goods that the government in India is trying to bring to the market. Now I'm not going to get into the details of all of them. I'm going to just step through a few so that you guys can get an idea of how these things work and then take it from there. Now not everything, in fact I need to update these slides, these two just went live. So we have a staged process to actually make this happen. So we start by building the digital public goods, inviting ecosystem players to come and integrate, start rolling it out, and that's when we usually say it's gone live. So this is live and these two just went live. They came out of the sandbox and went live. We have a couple which are still in design phases, so we have not yet actually rolled it out into production in India. So this is also a digital public journey that's evolving. Of course our identity journey and our payment journey are much older. So the payment journey, for example, started in 2015. This exercise started in 2018 and was actually started to implement. The government said let's do it in the middle of the COVID pandemic, in actually 2020. So it's only about three to four years old in terms of its journey. Now in general, and I don't know how it is in your countries, but I have not seen a lab report in India that wasn't like a printed report, which means it really came off a computer from somewhere, right? So health information is quickly going digital. So if I look at the Indian context and I think if I look at many of the other countries' context, you will still probably find doctors who like to talk to the patient and write a prescription on a paper, maybe tear it away and give it up. But when it comes to other things like lab reports or many other things, digitization is actually happening quite fast, and that's also very, very valuable information. So in India it's quite common that if you go to a hospital, they will do a lab test and after that you will get a little message on your phone, and then you can actually click on the message and you can view your report as a PDF on your mobile. I don't know how, can I have a show of hands how many countries who are here have it in their countries? Do you guys get access to, yeah, one. Nobody else? Nobody's even getting, yeah. So quite a few. So now the problem, what's the problem with this? The big issue or the problem with this is, approach is, that we are not actually taking this digital information and making it to a longitudinal patient history. So if I want you to find that report again after a couple of months, it's unlikely that you will find it. And in the context of with a doctor, it doesn't happen. The second problem is, the PDF is not something that's, it's easy for us as humans to read, it's easy for us to interpret and say, okay, this is what the report is. But let's say if I gave you the reports from multiple labs for the same parameter and say, okay, let's look at a trend of this. It's not that easy, unless you have some amount of machine readability into the document itself. So that's really what we are trying to do with this mission. So one of the key things, and this I'm talking about from the first digital public good on the left, the health information exchange and consent manager. So what we do is, we tell healthcare providers, hey, Mr. Healthcare provider, if you have a piece of health information that belongs to a patient and you want to share it digitally with the patient, do that by linking it to their health ID. So interesting word here, in India, that health ID is called an Aishman Bharat Health Account. So we use the word account instead of an ID because we want to kind of give the idea that we are depositing health information into your account. And so that's the idea. And the keyword here is linking, and we'll come to that as to why we have taken that as an approach. So no health information actually gets deposited, only a link to a health information gets deposited in your health account. And second, we say, okay, the information you're sharing, can you make it into a standardized format? So we have chosen an international standard that's called FHIR, which stands for Fast Health Interoperability Resources, to standardize the format of the documents that are kind of getting linked. So that's really what we are trying to do here. And what do we allow them to do? We can actually share all of these kind of things. So you can share diagnostic reports, you can share discharge summaries, OP consultation notes, prescriptions, immunization records, all of this can be linked to an Aabha. And it's by design. Actually there were many, many more that we could have started with. We intentionally chose the most common ones, the most useful ones in healthcare, and so we started with minimal information. And we also chose things that healthcare patients, sorry, providers were happy to share with their patients. So to give you an example of what is not shared, in India, for example, if you stay in a hospital, the hospital creates, by law, much more information, including, for example, your OT notes. They create something for every day of your stay, especially when you're in ICU. All of this they keep with them and they call it indoor records. They don't like sharing it unless you ask for it. And so we have also picked the ones that they are comfortable sharing so that we can get the ecosystem started. Now I said that all of this gets linked into something we are calling as a health account or a health ID. So how do patients actually get that? What we have given is we have created a whole bunch of apps. So in UPI, in the payment ecosystem, you saw private providers who were creating apps. So similarly in the health ecosystem, we have invited private parties to come in and build consumer apps. We call these consumer apps as PHR apps or personal health record apps. And there's one app from the government. So this app here you see as Aarogya Setu. That's the app that the government is promoting. All the other apps that you see are apps that is coming from the private ecosystem. So we want to encourage competition, better design, better solutions for consumers from the private ecosystem. So you can download any one of these apps and in those apps you can actually create your health account. So it takes just a few seconds for you to actually create your health account. And we also have the whole system designed for people who carry absolutely no phones or have only feature phones. So we have a card that you can get at a hospital if you are somebody who does not carry a phone or have only a feature phone. And that card actually has a little QR code that you can show and use when you actually want to collect your health record. So that's the core idea. So it's inclusive in its thinking. Even if you don't have a phone, you will be able to collect your records digitally into your longitudinal records and you will be able to share it for your health care. Now if you go to any of the hospitals, you guys are in Bangalore. In fact, this is rolled out in many public hospitals in Bangalore. If you go to a public hospital in Bangalore, you will see, you can see a little QR code that's pasted at the entrance of the hospital. So at the registration desk, you have, just like you have for payments, I'm sure you've already done, tomorrow you're doing demos, but okay. So I'm sure in India you have seen how easy we do payments with scanning a QR code. We have borrowed that for health patient registration. So when you go into a hospital, you just scan your QR and you're instantly registered in the hospital software. So you are using a PHR app. So as a patient, you could be having any of these PHR apps. The hospital is using some software that you don't, of course, know, but you can just go scan and they will instantly register you. And we have more than a hundred thousand patients who use this to register themselves now. Every day we call this scan and share. So A, it saves, you know, no typing because, you know, the information is coming automatically. And actually we found that in public hospitals, which had very long queues, it was able to cut the queue time down. You know, people would wait about 60 minutes for a registration. Now with this scan, they're able to do it in about four minutes. So huge benefit. One of the reasons why people are using it is because they don't have to stand in the queue for registering themselves. Right? Now, what would I really want you to remember? The core idea that ABDM is doing is something very simple. If a healthcare provider is generating a medical record, what we said is we want them to link it with their ABHA. And then if a healthcare provider wants to view the records linked with the ABHA, it can only be done with the patient's consent. And so India is building on this architecture, which I don't know if you guys have spoken about, which is the consent-based architecture, where you can only get access to the records with consent. And India's consent-based architecture is also very granular in the sense that the patient will have control over who they're giving access records to, which records they're giving access to, how long, and even after they have given it, if they change their mind, they have the right to revoke it and remove access to your record. So that's the power of the system that's being put behind it. So one more level of detail for people who are tech-interested to understand how does this actually work. It's quite simple. So the National Health Authority, they are running this digital public, I should not use the word G there, digital public infrastructure for the country. And you'll see there are four boxes that you see there. The one on the top we have understood, that's basically the health account system, where people can have a health account. These two are registries. Have you guys covered, spoken about registries as a concept here? Yeah. So comes to the simple question, can anybody add information to my ABHA? Who can add information to my ABHA? Who do you think should be allowed to add information to my ABHA? So clearly, you want only trusted entities to add information to your ABHA. And how do you create trust? How do you know that this is really a hospital, this is really a doctor? So we do that through the idea of registries. So we have two registries. We have something called the health professional registry, which ultimately is going to cover. So again, it's got multiple purposes. So for example, India cannot answer the question today as to say, how many oncologists, surgical oncologists of a certain specialty are in a certain place, right? So it's able to answer such questions, but also to be able to build trust in terms of saying, hey, you are really the entity that you are and you can participate in this digital ecosystem. So how does it start? As a user, we are expecting you as a patient to be able to first get yourself an ABHA. How do you do that? You do that with any PHR app or you can get it when you go to a hospital. And what do we expect you to do with it? We expect you to share it with the healthcare provider when you visit the hospital. So you can share it by just doing the scan and share I spoke about in the previous slide or you show your card to the registration counter which scans the card is the two ways in which you can kind of do it. So the hospital basically gets now information about you and your health account and then in they, we expect the hospital to now use a software that's been modified to be what we call as ABDM compliant. And what that software does when it creates a new health information for you is that it links it with your ABHA. And the moment it links it with your ABHA, you will get a notification on your phone saying, hey, you have a new health record that's been added to your ABHA and you can actually view it on your phone. And not only can you view it later on if you go to another hospital or if they ask you, you can actually share it back again with your consent. And that's really the architecture that we're building and we're building this for national scale. This approach, the health information continues to stay here. And it's only passed between this entity and the user or the other facility. So we call it a federated architecture. The government itself and no health information goes through, even though we use the word, it's a health information exchange, but the actual exchange does not pass through it. Even if any information passes through, it's encrypted. So it's by design, it's privacy by design, because we do not want even the government who's operating these DPIs to be able to peek into or have access to any health information without the user's consent. And that's the crux of these ideas and this architecture. So how did we get here? For people who are interested in, you know, the journey to create digital public goods in your own country, it's usually a long process, at least for us in healthcare it was. We started by writing these ideas down that India should do digital public infrastructure in healthcare. We published that as a document. That happened in July 2018. The publication was done by India's planning department. And then they said, they put it out for public consultation, they got very, very positive feedback from the market. And so they said, oh, okay, this looks interesting. Let's create a committee to see how to make this real. So the second item that happened was this committee which said, what does it take to implement something like this? And one of the recommendations of the committee was that, hey, you need to give money and you need to have a department and a strong technology team if you want to do something like this. And that was identified to be the National Health Authority. So they gave the budget and the money in the middle of COVID, June 2020. They also asked us to launch it in three months, which we couldn't. But we did manage to get a pilot going by September 2020. And then we really managed to get to national rollout only by 2021. So but still a long journey. I should tell you that people like me have been working on this. I started 2016 on the first concepts, but it really took, you know, this is the first thing that we have to show is in 2018, really on terms of the screen. So and it's not done. You know, I think it'll take another decade because I'll show you the challenges in terms of actually bringing this to life because what we have brought to life is the digital public goods. The core challenge is actually getting ecosystem adoption in something like healthcare. Now it's very clear that if we have to make this happen, we have to get and I just maybe want to go back to, I'll use this slide and then come back. So how do we actually get the ecosystem to participate? What does it take? And in healthcare and every probably every digital public infrastructure or every sector is slightly different. But in this case, the challenge that we have is going back to our 200,000 health facilities, how do you convince all these guys to participate? So one of our biggest issues is that we do not have strong laws and regulators who oversee it. For example, with financial payments, you have the RBI, which acts as a very strong regulator. India is a federal structure. There's absolutely nobody. I, by the way, one of the things I do, apart from working as an advisor to the government is I run a chain of eye hospitals and I can tell you that there is absolutely no regulators who sit on our heads and can push us to do or push the healthcare industry to make changes. So that's one of the biggest problems that we have. But even before we can convince them, we need to prepare the second layer, the software layer. If you saw the previous diagram, you'll know that we need to convince these guys to basically integrate with all of these digital public goods. So they need, if they have a version 1 of their software or version X of their software, we need an X plus 1 that is integrated and compliant. And so that's our first big challenge. That is, we need to get all of these guys on board and then we need to convince them to go back, roll it out in those facilities as part of the overall thing. So, so far, out of the 2000 vendors, we have convinced about 100 to complete this process. And how do we do it? We actually have something that we have created called the ABDM sandbox. So the ABDM sandbox is like an environment where we host the digital public infrastructure and we invite parties to come in, integrate with the API. So we put all the documentation out, we put the specification out, we have a team to hand hold and explain. We run webinars to all of these development companies saying, what does it mean to make your software ABDM compliant? And how do you actually integrate, test, comply, make sure that the security is solid. And after the end of the process, we give them a key, actually a production key, which gives them access to the production digital public infrastructure. So you cannot get access to the production digital public infrastructure unless you can clear the sandbox process. And that's really the thing the National Health Authority runs. And that's the primary way with which it's trying to create this engagement with the ecosystem. Of course, just by putting up a sandbox, you don't get it. So we are also doing two other things. I don't have slides for it. I do have slides in the other deck. But one, we are giving away money now. So we basically said, hey, rupees 20 for every health record you link with an ABA account for the next X period of time. And we are giving that money to the healthcare provider and we are giving money to the software provider. So it's 20 rupees to the healthcare provider, 5 rupees to the software vendor who helped him do it, so that we can actually kick start and get the ecosystem doing. The second thing is, we are trying to make sure that this aligns. So India just passed its data privacy laws. And one of the things that the data privacy laws is, of course, health data gets covered under the data privacy laws. One of the things that is required is that all healthcare folks have to comply. And what we are trying to do is we are making sure that if you deploy an ABDM compliant software in your hospital or clinic, that's going to make it the easiest way for you to comply with the data protection bill. So those are the kind of incentives that we are driving to do for adoption. We have also broken up the ecosystem into three groups. We are talking separately to people who build software for the government, people who build software for the large corporate hospitals, and also people who build software for small clinics and labs, because we found that there are three different kind of class of groups that you need to engage with in terms of how we are doing this. So that's our journey in healthcare so far. And those are some results. So on a population of about what we are now 1.4 billion, we have managed to kind of crore is about that's about 10. It's hard to convert. Yeah, but so what let's say that's about one third of the population. Yeah, about one third of the population has managed to get itself and health account. And we have got about a mere 31 crore, you know, again, you know, sorry for the numbers. And we have about 200,000 that's a lack is 100,000. So we have about 200,000 health facilities that have started to register and about 200,000 health professionals have started. So the journey is on. But of course, we have a long way to go for this health information and health stack to kind of pick up. Yeah, that's about it. I didn't have anything else that I wanted to talk to you folks today, but happy to take any questions or any queries that you might have. The mic's coming. Hi, you're going first? Hi, hi. There's somebody behind you going first. Sorry. Yeah. I heard you speak about NCDs and others. Yeah. Is there any provision made for infectious diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, comorbidity, any of them? Yeah. So India does have, it has a separate program for tuberculosis. In fact, we had taken up eradicate TB by 2025 as a mission, in fact, a few years ago, but I don't think we'll hit that. But we do have vertical programs. There are almost about, I think, 23 different vertical programs. We also have specific laws which require reporting for a certain set of diseases, especially infectious diseases. So one of the things that we're also trying to do as part of this mission is try to automate that reporting. So when a lab gets a positive test for a whole bunch of, it's called notified diseases in India. If you were to get a positive hit in a diagnostic lab for any of these notified diseases, we are trying to make sure that you can send the data to the government through this mission. So it's one of the benefits of using an ABDM compliant software is that you automatically report such information. Yeah. So this is based on Aadhaar? Yes, it's one of the choices. So of the big number there, about 90% of them have a linkage to Aadhaar. So we said that the system can be used even for people without a smartphone. So how do you really provide consent without a smartphone or without any of these interfaces? So we actually use Aadhaar and we use biometric authentication as the way that you can actually provide consent in the system. And again, the consent itself is, the government kind of draws the box of the scenario so that it can restrict, make it very simple for you to know what you're consenting for as part of this. So it is built on the national ID, but it is separated from the national ID because India has a, there's a history and there's a bunch of legal regulations in India that restrict the use of the national ID for certain purposes. Right? So that was one part of it. The second reason was national IDs like Aadhaar are like permanent, right? So once you get one, you cannot change it. And we felt that for sensitive health information, people may want to have two accounts. So think of it like this, right? So in India, we don't restrict you and say you can have only one bank account to keep your money. If you want, you can have two bank accounts. You can move your money from A to B. So think of the similar idea here saying you have one identity, but you could have two Aadhaars and you could move your information behind it if you wanted, where you kept all the information. So if you were going to see a doctor for a cough and cold, you may not want to give you a full history which has everything including your abortion details or your other details, right? Or your, so we think that there's going to be challenges that's going to come into play when it comes to how sensitive health information is shared by patients and wants to be managed by patients. And so we have given certain provisions. We have not reached that stage yet, but we have made provisions to make sure that the control is in the hands of the patients. And so we have given them the choice. So do you use KYCs for, to integrate it with Aadhaar? Yes. When you create the Aadhaar, you have to do a KYC. Since it's always consent driven, in a case of emergencies and stuff like that, when the hospital wants to invoke the, you know, just before operation, wants to know the history and all, how does it work? So we have a concept of, we have two other consent concepts. One called deemed consent and the second is called, I forget the other term that we use, but essentially we have an authorized guy. So, you know, if somebody is a person who works at an emergency care department of a hospital, he can essentially get access to the data where he basically says I'm overriding the system to get access to your data for this purpose. So for limited case, use case scenarios, we are designing, it's not yet in production, we are designing these kind of, where he provides, he basically has an override to get access to the data only in emergency case scenarios. So your new law will have to provide that? Sorry? Your new law will have to provide that? It has to be recognized by the law. Yeah. And so then that will go through the Aadhaar number route? No, so the consents don't go through... Not the consent, the emergency provider. Yeah, no, it will still not be linked to Aadhaar, it will be linked to the data privacy bill. The data privacy and data protection, in fact, the data protection law of India already has an exemption for health. It says that in certain health emergencies, the provider should be able to override, but it doesn't specify the mechanics and we are hoping that we can do that as part of this digital public infrastructure. The medical supplies is also a major piece of this ecosystem. Yes. So does your overall framework entail the medical supplies? Yeah, no. So we have not found a use case which is a digital public infrastructure which really covered medical supplies. So we did not. There were specific use cases within government for, in public health infrastructure for medical supplies, including cold chain, vaccination tracking, are the supplies there in certain places and so on, but we did not see a national level need for a digital public infrastructure. So we have not, so far we have not created any digital public infrastructure for medical supplies, but there would be digital public goods or open source software and I think that's coming up in a slide next, where we are saying for certain areas and sectors, there can be digital public goods that makes it easy for adoption. Here we are really focusing on these three big use cases that I spoke about. Let me just put that slide up. It's a better slide to live on the... Yeah. So we are only focusing on these three as the big use cases in many ways. All right. Thank you. So I was more interested in the tech part of the, I mean, the presentation. Very good work you've done so far. So my question is, how were you able to get, you said today about 2000 plus players. Yeah. I mean, already providing some form of health softwares, right? Yeah. And then you brought this platform and you have 100 plus who has plugged in. Who has integrated through APIs. Integrate the APIs. How were you able to do that? I mean, you are taking bread from them, right? So I don't know if we can... You can go to browser. So just go to sandbox.abdm.gov.in. I mean, the point is how were you able to convince them. How to convince them. Okay. Then okay. It's not about the sandbox. I understand that concept already. It's how you're able to convince them. Money. Money. Yeah. Health care is a, you know, people will do some things because it's good for other people. But mostly at the bottom of it all, it will come down to what's the financial incentive for them to participate. So it's been very clear that it's either got to be a regulatory stick saying, you know, you don't want to go to jail. So you do this. Or it has to be, hey, do you want to make more money? Do this. So, you know, it's largely going to come to that for incentive alignment. India is trying to use a mix of both. So the digital, the data protection bill is the stick. And we are trying to say, hey, if you want to stay, Mr. Health care provider, if you want to stay compliant to the data protection bill, use an ABDM compliant software. Okay. Right? So then the next question they ask is, hey, where do I get my ABDM compliant software? And then we say, hey, ask what software are using right now. You know, do you know that that guy can become ABDM compliant? So they go tell the guy, are you ABDM compliant? They're saying, if I have to stay safe, you have to be ABDM compliant. So that's the chain that we are using. And the second chain that we are using, we are saying for the next year, we are going to be giving away rupees 20 for every health record that you link to you, Mr. Health care provider and rupees 5 to the software guy who is helping you do it. So all of this is driving a set of players to come forward and say, okay, let's get ready because there's money and there's the benefit that we'll get more business. If we are the first to be ABDM compliant, we can get more business because people will be looking for ABDM compliant software. All right. Okay. So you also said you had an app, but you invited more people. That's for consumers. Yes. For the consumer. Why did you invite more people? I'm just asking. Why? Yes. You have an app already. I invited more people to be around the app. Yeah, because, you know, see, the reality is that, let's say you have diabetes or hypertension. It's quite possible that somebody is going to make a great app for you to manage your diabetes. Right. And I don't think a single government app and one solution can solve everybody's problems and needs. Right. Somebody with cancer may require something very different. Somebody with something else may require very different. So our theory is that there has to be an open ecosystem of participants. And we want to keep it available and open for the players. And we don't want to box it down to say, hey, only the government can do this. So, very clearly, we have taken a call saying that the, let me just use this slide so that you can get a sense of it. Yeah. So if you look at this, the government's role, we have boxed the government role and saying the government's only going to do this. Right. This is coming from the ecosystem. Okay. And the PHR apps are coming from the ecosystem with one choice from the government. So the role of the government, and I think it's very important to think about that, the role of the government is not to provide software to your hospitals and clinics. We are saying that's a private market. And the private market will provide that. Same thing. It's the private market that will provide software for patients to use and see their health records. So we want to create an active ecosystem. And the role of the government is an enabling role. So essentially, you're not storing the data. I am not. The government is not storing data. No, no, it has no data. It has no access to data, but it's enabling all of these use cases. It's enabling everybody to collect their health records. It's enabling data for, you know, public health purposes without actually the other important thing, right? If you go look at a hospital, it's probably using the software already. The government doesn't want to go and say, throw away your software. So it's instead giving it a path, saying, hey, ask your software guy to make a little bit of changes so that he can participate. All right. Right? Go ahead. Okay. My question is around telemetry, right? And to be honest, I think that's what's generally missing in a lot of the software we use. So here, there's, of course, I'm linking to health records that still sit with the hospitals. Yes. Now, if the hospital is offline for whatever reason, right, that record cannot be accessed when it's needed. Okay. I assume there's some kind of track. There has to be. The theme here is, so where is the telemetry here that actually says, look, it's one thing to link a record. It's quite another to not be available when the record is needed, right? So we have a two, we take what we call a two. So this is called a federated architecture, and you're absolutely right. If a node in the federated architecture is shut down, you're going to have holes in your record. So basically, all PHR apps also come with a locker or a storage. So there are two copies. There's one here with the hospital that created it. And there's two with the PHR app that you as a consumer use. So that's the thing. And when you do these sharing activities, you can either share from your app, your own storage, or you can share from the network. If you have two copy, one with the hospital provider, one with the personal PHR app, how you design the surveillance part? Surveillance? Surveillance actually does not, so these are individual records. So this is a full individual record. That's a full individual record with personal information. Surveillance information actually does not have any personal information. It's an aggregate information that emits from here to a national service. So for example, just give an example. I mean, it doesn't do this. But it will, for example, if I say every lab has to report how many HBA1C tests they did yesterday and how many of them were positive. So it's only two numbers. And that is the kind of data that will get emitted from here. It doesn't actually emit which patients they did the tests on or any of those kind of things. So that's how the surveillance data works. You can get it, you can like, you can get it if you think that you want to track it down to the individual. But in general for the public health purposes, you do not get any personal information. For different type of diseases, for example, communicable diseases. Yeah. You need to have. So only where there is a law. So if there is a, for example, we have something called the, in India we have something called the notifiable diseases law, which requires personal information to be part of the notification. Only in those cases it comes through. But for anything else which is in public health where there is absolutely no law or notification, we don't allow it. Just for example, for a COVID example. Yeah. COVID would probably come under the notifiable diseases act. In fact, in India, we actually did it under something else. We did it under something called the disaster management act. So we, I mean, basically the government will find a rule. If it wants the information, it will know, it knows how to pass the appropriate act. Yeah. So how does DPI in healthcare solve for fundamental problems like lack of skilled manpower or lack of infrastructure? Can it or if it's how? Yeah. So at this point, I don't think, at least these DPIs that we have chosen, I don't think will do it except to provide maybe certain level of transparency and information about where the gaps are. But it won't really be able to effectively address, like for example, poor infrastructure or other issues are not something that these DPS will be able to directly address. That is, that's my thesis. Please. Just one more question. So in relation to what the gentleman said there in terms of the data staying at the hospitals or diagnostic centers, is there some level of health data aggregation that happens on the system? Yes. So there are two things that will apply, which is important, I think, to think about. One is on all of these guys, we are actually bringing up what we call as a data retention policy. So all of them, if they participate in ABDM, they also agree to retain data for a certain period of time. So right now for digital data, the timing that we have set is about 10 years. 10 years. Right. And then on the PHR side, you as a user, you can have your own storage that you keep forever. So that's the two places of storage and that's the retention time periods you can think of. In terms of aggregation, yes. So the aggregation is happening here. It's only, like I said, some summary aggregations. And then we have, as part of the reporting, the public health system reporting, we are looking at a protocol where it gets reported for public health purposes. And we also have, so to help you answer this a little better, a corporate hospital in Bangalore does not want to reveal, say, how many cardiac stents it put last month. They will treat that as competitive information. They'll say, hey, why should my competitors know what's going on? So the data that we are looking to release for public health will typically take a large enough geographic area, say the city of Bangalore, without naming which provider. So it is privacy preserving not just for the patient, but it's privacy preserving for the provider. So no data from the data, you should not be able to go back and say that I figured out how many stents this particular hospital put last month. And we are done. On time. Thanks, everyone.

**Video Transcript:**
> Let me just take you through one video that explains how the future is getting shaped with an idea like Becken Protocol, a future that is a bit more futuristic than ONDC. By the way, Becken is probably the latest of this whole DPI thinking that is coming out of this ground zero building of all the DPIs. I would call it the youngest, it looks cool, you look young, but of all the things that Becken has been enabling, ONDC are all very recent ideas. This idea is not something that is proven success, but the underlying essence of that carries the wisdom of the same DPI thinking that Pramod has been talking about, which has been delivering the goods for us over the last decade or so. It's sort of a culmination of all of that and kind of taking it ahead. You have heard a lot since morning, but I just want you to kind of register these three words and I will touch upon these three words. I think Rahul explained some of this. One is unbundling. I think that word is high on the word abuse index today because you have been hearing unbundling since morning. That is the essence of DPI thinking. The second word that I want to talk about is scale. Anything that you do for DPI is solving for population scale. It is not solving for one village or one city, but for a population scale. I would say DPI is a bad idea if you are not solving for scale and diversity. Third is interoperability. It's a multi-syllable mumbo-jumbo that we will try and solve for by solving for interoperability. Now there is one interoperable thing that we do every day, every second, every moment. It's in play even right now. The natural languages. Can you imagine if this language, let's say English or Hindi, if it did not have a common dictionary and if I were to say that my English has a different dictionary than yours, is English interoperable? If I say this laptop on the desk is not a laptop but a bird because my dictionary calls it a bird, I am incommunicable right with language. The reason why language is interoperable because somewhere everybody agreed to a common dictionary of words, nouns, grammar, everything. It kind of makes this a common way for us to communicate. Language is fundamentally interoperable. We are nobody without that interoperability. Imagine if the same sort of interoperability we can achieve for machines to communicate. As the technology evolved, as the digital systems came about, we sort of abdicated this fundamental feature of interoperability somewhere along the way. Becken, okay now the video is back but Becken is actually going back to that way of the internet which sort of did interoperability at population scale. Let me explain all of that but why don't you watch this video and share your reactions before I get into what's actually happening behind the scenes when it solves for interoperability and economic transactions of any kind. So, this is the world where the city has built an open network for energy powered by Becken protocol, interconnecting multiple energy service providers and simplifying energy transactions. Alice uses a UEI app of her choice to discover EV charging stations near her. All the charge point operators on the network are able to respond with available chargers. She is able to choose a charging station, assess its availability and even reserve a slot to charge her car all over the open network. We will stop here. Do you see anything different in this basing whatever you have seen in the digital world? What is so different here? What is it trying to do? So, I will take that example. You said decentralized network. So, let me just sort of unpack it for you guys. If you are not a registered user on Amazon today, can you find the sellers on Amazon? If you are not a registered user on Uber today, can you find drivers on Uber? If I am not on WhatsApp, can you communicate to me with WhatsApp? So, what is the construct here? The construct is a platform which is closed in the way that the consumer and provider need to be on the same platform. Whatever is the economic resource that is under consumption here, whether it is grocery, ride, energy, doctor's calendar for teleconsultation, we have this systemic risk in the design which requires, mandates both consumer and provider to be on the same platform. This also necessitates a condition of having somebody to bring the two people onto the platform, right. The consumers and the provider onto one platform, therefore there is an intermediary. Now, you have to solve for, there should be an incentive for consumer and provider to be on the same platform, right. If you have enough number of sellers, then I as a consumer want to come onto your platform and identify sellers. If I have enough number of drivers, I would choose Uber as an app, but it is not going to happen until that intermediary is trying to bring both supply and demand onto one platform. Now as much as these platforms have been successful in many ways, when you are dealing with substantial scale like the scale that India deals with, you know these platforms have not grown beyond the 5, 6, 7 percent penetration. E-commerce in India, B to C, is about 7 to 8 percent. The same 25 million number that we have, Pramod keeps saying in the morning, we hit the wall at 25th or 50th million at best. Uber is even less. A Delhi metro does 4 million trips a day. Uber across the entire country does 2 million trips. That's one city doing 4 million trips on metro and 2 million trips on one platform across the country does. So you, if you were to solve for, how do you create a digital mobility ecosystem that can do 100 million trips? How do you create a commerce ecosystem that allows every small business to do business online? If you have to solve for that, one of the ways, one of the risks that we have to overcome is this risk of coincidence of presence wherein the buyer and seller need to be on the same platform and make enough money such that the intermediary also makes money. What we have is a situation where intermediary makes all the money and the others at the far end are suffering. Like a driver has to pay 60 percent commission on a low price and not taking enough income, right, for its, to sustain its livelihood, its own livelihood. So how do we change that? How do we, how do you overcome this systemic risk in the design of how economic transactions on the internet happen? Now this is not some radical idea that backend protocol has come up with. Actually went old school and we say let's go fall back on the design of internet itself. If you look at all the population scale technology systems like internet, mobile phones, emails, actually do not have this problem. Do you have to use a say browser of the company which is building the website? You could use any browser to go to any website and there's nobody in the middle. I could use Hotmail to send an email. You don't have to be on Hotmail to receive that email. You could be on Gmail or any other platform. I don't even have to know which platform you are on so long as I know your email ID. And again there's nobody in the center mediating that. Telephones, right, I could be on Airtel, you could be on Vodafone. I don't expect you to get on to Airtel to take my call or receive my call or call me. All the population scale infrastructure systems like internet, telecom, which has billions and billions of people, are fundamentally interoperable. Pramod mentioned telecom has a protocol called GSM which is the language for two telecom systems, machines to understand voice, exchange voice or data. Internet has HTTP protocol which makes anybody who can make a browser, anybody can put up a website, they talk to each other. Those two applications can talk to each other. Telephones has a protocol called as SMTP which makes any two email servers talk to each other. There is no one person in the center trying to control this coordination between a sender and receiver. Well, that is not the case with WhatsApp because you got to be on WhatsApp for a person to talk to. If the other person is not on WhatsApp, you cannot have this conversation. Now which is where we said is it possible, very simple question we have been asking, if money with UPI can go from any app to any app, I can be on phone pay but I can make a money transfer to Paytm, if UPI was a protocol, why is not commerce like UPI, like email, like telecom? Why just commerce? Why cannot education, online education be like emails or telecom? Why cannot energy, discovering and EV charging be like that? Now what does it do? It fundamentally, it fundamentally opens up the possibility of, the point that Pramod mentioned right, you do not need one Uber or one Airtel or one Amazon to solve the problem at scale. If you create a DPI infrastructure, in this case an open network like the internet, what are you doing? You are not solving it by itself, you are distributing that ability to solve. So what is happening in a network like ONDC or in a network like Namayatri or in this example of an EV charging network is that you are breaking the problem, splitting the needs of the problem into multiple sets, so you have one platform that has the consumer, it does not have to worry about where the provider is, there are whole set of other platforms like a Namayatri taxi app or an EV charging company or a retail store on an online app like Shopify, each solving for their ends of the users and then they coming and discovering each other without having to be on each other's platform registered. Being on WhatsApp, I am able to discover 80 different charging companies, charging points in my neighborhood without having to be registered on their platforms. In Bangalore, we have about 200,000 drivers, 200,000, 2 lakh drivers who have chosen to not use Uber but get on to Namayatri in this decentralized peer-to-peer. So when you unbundle and put consumer on a different platform and a provider on a different platform and you make them talk, you get what a gentleman just said, a decentralized peer-to-peer network. So if e-commerce is not, think of commerce not as a platform, think of EV charging not as a platform, think of teleconsultation not as a platform but start thinking of it as open networks which is what internet is, only difference is internet solve for exchange of information which is a content web, what Beckin is trying to do is to try to create the transaction web for any economic transaction. Now probably this is my last two minutes and then come here, I will take questions and then I will hand it over to Kamya. What happens in a typical economic transaction? What happens in a ride booking? What happens in an online purchase or in an EV discoverability? There are four steps that fundamentally happen in any economic transaction life cycle. One is you are searching for something, say I want to find an EV charging, I want to find a taxi driver, I want to find a doctor or I want to find a teacher in my neighborhood, I want to find an advice for my crop which is what you just heard from JB, that's the discovery phase and then you find something, one is good, can I find the EV charger, can I find the driver, can I place an order without having to be on that person's platform, can I book order that resource, can I block the EV charger, can I buy that advice, can I get the taxi driver, can I book that ride, that's the order part. The third part is, is the order getting fulfilled, is the service actually getting delivered, whether it's a service or a goods, in ONDC you are delivering even grocery, the goods getting delivered, that's the fulfillment part. The fourth part in this sort of a DNA strand is the post fulfillment, not always the service is fulfilled effectively as per expectations, you may want to do cancellation, you may want to do return or refund or even raise a grievance or even rate the service or the service provider there are these four blocks. Now surprisingly and I want you guys to ask this question, think of any sector where there is an economic transaction between any consumer and provider, I give you an example of EV, think of mobility or any sector in your imagination, even manufacturing, you know just humor me on this, you will always see that DOFP, discovery order fulfillment, post fulfillment will be the essential sort of the DNA strand of that transaction. Beckin has generalized that just like how UPI was a one and a half page, we couldn't make it one and a half, we made it two and a half with DOFP, so it's a two and a half page specification, a set of vocabulary, it's not a platform, it's just a bunch of vocabulary that machines understand to execute a discovery order fulfillment, post fulfillment for any economic resource, yeah. What you didn't see in that video in the interest of time, maybe we can share it later, is that it doesn't stop at EV discovery, that EV charging company itself, where does it buy energy from today? The energy is trying to buy from the grid, now with this network in India, nowhere else in the world this is happening, in India we have a way to discover energy from an idle battery, which is solar powered, which means green energy, imagine a school bus lying, electric school bus lying idle, right, it just probably runs four hours a day and it's lying idle, but it's a fully charged battery, how do I monetize an idle battery? Is energy a resource, an idle battery an economic resource, can I put a DOFP on that? So EV charging company is able to put a DOFP on an idle battery and buy green energy at a lesser price, because that is a price for an idle battery, right, it would have otherwise not have been monetized. So in India we have a possibility because of interoperability and open network that you will be able to buy energy from an EV charging station which is green at a price lesser than the grid energy. I don't have to explain if this is the possibility, why will market not adopt it, right, because there is a natural incentive for private innovators to jump on to this infrastructure like how many companies like Amazon jumped on to a network like internet to reimagine how we buy things. Open network is creating that possibility for players to now start imagining should I play the double sided game of bringing the consumer and provider on to my platform or rather expand the pie as Pramod said by playing one side of the game but playing it very well and offer things that we can't even imagine today. There is nothing in the design of internet that would have told you that there will be a charge GPT after 50 years. That is the power of generalization that can unleash a whole lot of innovation. So I can't even sit and imagine what an open network can unlock tomorrow. One of the, I will probably start with this whimsical example and imagination that I often share, you are in Kormangala, okay, this is like the worst traffic hell out there in the world in terms of getting anywhere out. If you want to reach airport, taking Uber, it will take you two hours. Let's say you want to drink something on the way. Uber will not get you coffee. If you want Starbucks, Starbucks will not get you the ride. But imagine there will be a buyer app on ONDC which can get you a ride, place an order for coffee along the way from all the coffee, Starbucks, if Starbucks is your favorite and have that coffee delivered to a delivery address which is a moving car of another company, that is interoperability. Uber doesn't know that somebody is getting served coffee inside the car, Starbucks doesn't know that the guy is actually in the car who is getting the coffee, but somebody else like a Google map or a Paytm using backend protocol on ONDC can make this happen. It unlocks a whole combinatorial innovation just like how internet unlocked innovation. So that's the possibility India is making. It's a kind of a, I mean, everything has been audacious with DPI, whatever we've done. So this is one of those next things that we are trying to do. ONDC today does about six and a half million transactions a day. Namayatri does about 150,000 rides a day. So we are starting to achieve scale. But as India's scale is far bigger, we have to solve for 70 million MSMEs to do it. And as ONDC puts it, normally, the shop is opening for the country. Here also ONDC is saying, the country is opening for the shop. That's open network. Thank you so much.

   29. DPI Exemplar Stories I Nigeria: NIP Instant Payment  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95pz6seLtYc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95pz6seLtYc) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95pz6seLtYc&utm_source=chatgpt.com)


**Video Transcript:**
> I certainly believe that the instant payment or digital payment is the way to go. The mobility of cash is very slow and the cost of cash is also extremely very high. I think that the digital payment will ultimately eliminate, well, reduce cash, not eliminate but will reduce cash significantly within the society. Thank you very much. I think, like you've rightly noted, Nigeria has done very well in the area of payment and since the creation of NIPS, where I work, it was put together as a shared platform to help lower costs of doing business. Since I was done, a lot of things have been centralized and to also deal with the issue of identifying people on the platform in terms of payment, we created the BVN, which enables people to get into the financial service sector. It's a functional ID, where we have the foundational ID, which is the NIN, used in Nigeria, and with the BVN at least shared within the ecosystem among the banks. That helped to create a more secured way of transacting financially and identifying those who are transacting and what you are doing. So principally, NIPS has helped to lower costs for the players within the financial ecosystem by providing the shared infrastructure. And within that space as well, we created the NIPS Instant Payment, which pioneered a kind of revolution across the world. Because in Nigeria, it's not easy to get credit, especially the SMEs. What they need therefore to restock and to do business is just an instant credit, instant value in their account. The NIP was put together by NIPS to ensure that this is provided to the entire population as a way of receiving their payment as against relying on cash as a means of payment. I certainly believe that the instant payment or digital payment is the way to go. The mobility of cash is very slow, and the cost of cash is also extremely very high. If I need to send money to my maybe grandmother in the village, how do I send that if I'm going to send cash? As I said, the mobility is very, very slow and affects the delivery process. But the only way you can achieve that effective mobility and delivery is through the digital payment, which is the instant payment. I see a situation where there's going to be more deeper adoption of digital payment across the world, and then a lesser emphasis on cash. Because with cash, you have numerous problems. You have to count the cash, you have to ensure insurance, you have to ensure the cost of cash is low, you have to move cash from point A to B. But with instant payment or digital payment, straight on your mobile device or any other device that has been created for it, the money moves within milliseconds, and it's instant value that is given. So I think that the digital payment will ultimately eliminate, if not, well, reduce cash. Not eliminate, but will reduce cash significantly within the society. It was more of a design approach. So we had a design approach, and then we had collaboration among all stakeholders to understand the design of what needed to be done. And of course, you have to have players in the ecosystem who will adopt and see the value to it. So that design process has helped. And most of the things we've done so far in Nigeria, like the QR code payment in Nigeria, is instant payment as well. Most of the merchants derive a lot more value from instant payment. Recently, we just launched the domestic card, which is called the AfriGo scheme. It's live and it's working. And one of the values AfriGo also has brought to the table is instant T plus zero, instant settlement on POS transaction. We are the first country in the world to do that. And we are doing that to also deal with the issue associated with credit. So if you are selling, you need value, you have your value immediately. So to a very, very large extent, the value and the benefit for digital payment is extremely very, very high. Another area the central bank has helped is in the area of SANEF. And what does SANEF do? SANEF has created a pool of agents across the country with POS devices that are helping to bring banking closer to the people in the rural area. And what they do, you can go to an agent and have a bank account open. You can get your cash from there. You can withdraw, you can deposit from the agent. So the SANEF, I mean, working with the central bank has actually reduced the cost of banking. So you don't need a huge infrastructure. You just have an agent, it could be in a store or just one corner within a neighborhood and people come to you and then provide a lot of, get financial services. That's what withdraw money or transfer money is a lot more easier if you don't have a smartphone. So that's a delivery channel that has also helped to see the increased adoption within the Nigerian payment landscape. In G2P, the government has been paying a whole lot of palliative and social benefit to citizens of the poorest. Once they are determined, they rely on the NIP rail, no matter the party they are working on, to make sure that this is delivered to the various accounts. And today in Nigeria, the P2P is extremely very, very high in terms of payment. It runs into millions of transactions on a daily basis. So the adoption of the P2P is very high. Again, still within a certain population, but the revolution that is coming ahead with the QR code, especially with collaboration with the CAD rail in terms of the AfriGo, is going to leave this, we expect, about 200 to 300% adoption. Because even those who don't have digital phones will automatically be accommodated using their QR code, which is on the AfriGo card, and that will enable those instant payments. For the Bills payment, of course, Bills payment are going on. We have the eBills application. The APIs are available for people to integrate. We also have the NIP Direct Debit, which is also available to people for direct debit instructions and payment. And a lot of user cases have been built around that, and a lot of the APIs are consumed by our partners. And then providing offering. Most of the things that it also provides is instant payments, as well as instant settlement, especially for the eBills. So most of the utility providers are using the eBills for their collection process, and even some government agencies are also using the eBills for payment collection across the country. There were challenges, of course. There's always challenges with new things. One of the major challenges we faced was that of trust. People have always trusted cash more than any other channel. Gradually, we had to deal with the issue of trust by making sure that performance is high, settlement is real, and everything was happening. And people started trusting it. The other challenge is in the area of adoption. Adoption is critical. Most people still don't understand why it has to be digital. But we found out that within the youthful population, there's a lot more adoption as they get involved and try it out. So we're seeing all that apply. In the other area, again, there's cyber security issues. People trusting and ensuring that there is a safety net to transaction protection for their transactions and their security of password and then user name and so on. So that we also dealt with by assuring people and ensure that the fraud level or any wrong delivery of the payment is zero and next to nothing just to build the trust component. Then the other areas and the area of network, where you have the network areas where network is not readily available, then you have issues around that in terms of the delivery. But all these points I've mentioned, we're also dealing with them in terms of different approaches like for adoption and then trust matter, a whole lot of engagement going on in that area, creating awareness and creating benefits in terms of getting instant value. It is cheaper to have money in your bank account to carry out some other activities rather than collecting cash, going to the bank, counting money, spending time there, and then lodging it in. That creates a delay and cost as well. So we continue to create those awareness. And then the other way we've also dealt with it is the area of working with a coalition, a corporation of the willing. Not everybody will be willing, but for those who are willing, start off with them. Let them continue to use the delivery channels and so on. And from there you have more and more increasing the adoption of the payment platform. I think the next stage for the country is to accelerate adoption and financial inclusion, bringing in a lot of the financially excluded people, provide a safety net, and provide means where they can trust the digital payment process across the country. I think that's the next step that we're working on. Then you have the open banking framework, which has just been released by the central bank, and as we adopt that and then deepen that within the country, then we're going to see a whole lot of activities around that space. You look at the local as well as the cross-border interoperability, which is something we are working on. We've already done that with PAPS to connect all the African businesses together in terms of payment. So those are the things that you're going to see. And right now we're working with NIMSI, the National Identity Management Commission of Nigeria, to layer identity and payment together. And once that is done, that will of course deepen so you know who you're paying, deal with the issue of KYC. I mean, it's there right now, but to further deepen and bring the services in terms of payment closer. And it will also help the G2P, which the government is really pushing very well, G2P, to reach the people in rural areas, reach different people. And that's so you need identity, of course, for the payment to be not successful but efficient. And then you can have a whole lot of dashboard, a whole lot of presentation around who and who gets what, and also monitor the life cycle of those individuals. So those are the kind of things you'll be seeing there very soon. And what I see with the launch of AfriGo and the various use cases around AfriGo in Nigeria, which means you don't really need a smartphone to get to penetrate because you're going to have a card with everything that you need. And with that card, just open up a Pandora box or the card opens up a box full of opportunities for you. And then with that, you can access payments or access anything you want to do. And we're trying to, the card is being designed to work in an offline mode, so you don't need to be online to have that. And in the next two months, you're going to have that card provide instant settlement to merchants at every location. So once I put the card on the POS machine, automatically, by the time I'm removing the cash, you're getting credit. So we expect all this to deeply drive adoption of the digital payment system. In December, for instance, for the first time in the company's history, there was no freeze. We continued our job, and of course, there was not a single issue. That's the level of maturity that the payment platform have reached in Nigeria to the no freeze, no issues, seamless across the whole country. And that is just to increase the trust level. And since we've done that, we've seen growth trajectory across the payment platform. My voice of advice is very simple. They have to be bold. They have to be determined. And they also have to focus on the goals. And they shouldn't expect to convince everybody. You can start with the coalition of the willing. Not everybody gets to see the vision. So if you have two, three people who are seeing the vision with you, just start the process. But one thing I'm sure of is that the younger generation look forward to a digital payment and a seamless payment. The stress of cash is enormous. The cost of cash is enormous. So there's no other alternative than to go completely digital. And then work with relevant partners, create platform, work with the telcos in every country to ensure that at least the network is stable and is available. Then also find various ways without the smartphone to ensure that this digital delivery system of the payment is done. And of course, if they want to visit Nigeria and they need assistance from NEEBS, we're available to also educate them and assist them in terms of set up, in terms of what they want. And then they can come and learn from Nigeria with respect to what we've done in the past over 25 years in the payment space. And the central bank in Nigeria has been very, very supportive. And the government as well. So for the countries to succeed in this journey, they need the buying of their central bank and the buying of the government. We have been very lucky in Nigeria that government is fully in support of digitalization, as well as the central bank of Nigeria. Payments is layered on identity. It's very, very important. Don't try to go payment without identity. So the identity of the population of whoever is coming within your payment rail or payment space is very, very important. That will help you deal with the issue of KYC. It will deal with the issue of transparency. It will deal with the issue of fraud. And if processes are centrally managed, then automatically you'll be lowering costs of providing financial services. And whatever design is, we must not focus on those with the smartphone or those who live in the cities. We must also consider those people in the rural areas. Don't leave them behind. How are you going to serve them? How are you going to bring them on board? How are you going to make them trust the process? How are they going to make payment without hindrances and without frustration? So those are very important processes. And again, we don't lose our culture. We don't lose our environmental dependencies. In Nigeria, for instance, people like instant payment. They just want to get their value right now. So you have to factor in some of those cultural dependencies or issues in the delivery of this channel. So that's extremely, very, very important. And of course, keep your eyes on the ball. You have to monitor the systems, monitor the process, and have a very robust product team. And don't neglect your partners. Partners are very important within the ecosystem. Share your APIs. Make sure that the sandbox is available for people to test, anyone to test. A robust certification process. And then you encourage the partners to innovate and provide value to the citizens.

> This is Nigeria's story. Nigeria is a beacon of inspiration and innovation for digital transformation. Creating solutions that work for people, offline and online, helping micro and small enterprises flourish. Inspiring new waves of youth-led innovations across the continent of Africa. Nigeria is adopting the DPI approach to scale innovations. To create the digital highways and ensure 3 million more young people are future-ready. By ensuring interoperable unique digital identities for children will improve their access to success. Nigeria's future is its youth. With the digital highways supporting their growth, the youth in Nigeria can deliver exponential change for development. Meet Eunice, one of Nigeria's young entrepreneurs working with the Ministry of Digital Economy to design and implement digital public infrastructure. My participation in 3M's city program has improved my life professionally and personally. Because before now, I had no idea of what it means to be a UIU-Guides designer. But currently, I can comfortably explain to you what it is all about and also go to the extent of designing an app. Nigeria has committed to universal DPI safeguards as a necessity. Nigeria is committed to ensuring that its DPI does not exclude by creating choices for users. Nigeria is committed to ensuring that its DPI implementation overcomes existing barriers faced by women and every girl. Through removing those barriers in its DPI designs, Nigeria invests in its youth. For more information, visit www.nigirig.org








   31. The Benefits of Digital Public Goods and Digital Public Infrastructure

**Video Transcript:**
> Digital public goods are instruments in an economy that allow connectivity, that allow transparency, and allow people to work together collectively to achieve a certain set of goals, whether they are the sustainable development goals or simply the growth goals of an economy. So digital public goods are open source digital building blocks which can be used to fast track the achievement of our sustainable development goals. I think this is a remarkable movement and at the heart of the DPG movement is the idea of openness, interoperability, and sharing so that different organizations, countries, entities don't have to reinvent the wheel but can benefit off and build on top of what already exists, thereby simplifying, fast tracking the achievement of the sustainable development goals that are very dear to us. Open source software, open standards, open data were built by communities of contributors that did create and govern those resources. And the benefits are enormous because first it did launch this movement of innovation, this digital revolution, and it did empower the people because no one can expropriate you, nor change the price, nor take the control because you cannot build a monopoly on what we call in France digital commons. But what it means to be a digital public good is that no one owns them, they're freely available to all to use, and they are shareable. And this is why it's so important because what we see is that countries around the world are trying to solve the same problems. And if others have already developed a solution and made that openly available to everybody, then they can grab that and use it for their own purposes, solve their own problems. And this is why we're so excited about this, because they become building blocks for countries to work on their digital public infrastructures. For these goods to operate successfully and optimally, you do need the digital public infrastructure as well. Digital public infrastructure, in fact, is the one thing that assures interoperability and smooth functioning of an economy. When you take, for example, what has been happening in Ukraine and how the government, in the midst of a war situation, has used digitalization and digital governance to actually run their country, it shows you how digital public infrastructures make a difference to growth, to sustainability, sometimes even just for survival.








   32. Payments Innovation in Brazil  
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFx4zUYEJ3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFx4zUYEJ3Q) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFx4zUYEJ3Q&utm_source=chatgpt.com)


**Video Transcript:**
> Welcome back to the BIS Innovation Summit. My name is Hyun-Sung Shin. I'm the Economic Advisor and the Head of Research here at the BIS. And in this session, we're going to explore how central banks can play a pivotal role in financial inclusion. Now, just to set the stage, of course, central banks issue the unit of account, and so trust in the currency is ultimately grounded in the trust in the central bank. And some central banks actually build on its role at the center of the monetary system also to provide public payment infrastructures. And these infrastructures serve as the foundational public good that sets the backdrop for the competition for the private sector. And in this session, we're going to be exploring a really interesting example from Brazil, which is the PIX instant payment system. It was launched in November 2020, just over a year ago, but it's really seen a very rapid adoption. And this session actually coincides with the publication of a BIS bulletin that we've just sent out that describes the experience in Brazil. And today, we're really privileged because we have the privilege of talking to the person who's been guiding this whole initiative. It's Governor Roberto Campos Neto of the Central Bank of Brazil. And we're really looking forward to this chat, Roberto, and welcome. Thank you, Mr. Neto. Thank you, Roberto. So let's just start with the main motivation and your assessment so far. I mean, the PIX payment system was rolled out as a way of expanding access to digital services in the payment system. And it's just been over a year now. What is your assessment as to how well this launch has gone? Well, thanks for the question. Thank you, everyone. I want to congratulate the BIS on the bulletin. It's excellent. It's been very important to work together. I would probably start saying that when we designed the whole program for the central bank, we had this agenda that we used to call BCHash, which was basically an agenda that wanted to foster innovation, inclusion, financial education. There's a lot of objectives, all of them very connected to technology. We always thought technology was this democratizing instrument in the process of financial intermediation. So the first thing was trying to understand what was the tendency that we would see. We recognized that there was an exponential growth in technologies when we looked at financial intermediation, but we wanted to see where we're going from here. And the first thing to notice, and that was early in 2019, is there was this run to build vertical data chains as we are going to this information economy. So we were seeing this migration between content, payment, and texting. So whenever you look in emerging market countries, either Google was trying to do chats or WhatsApp was trying to do payments. So we were seeing that there was this run so that at some point in time, the whole chain would capture the whole process of selling a product from advertising to sale to payments and to interpreting what people thought about the product. So when we look at that, the first thing that came to our minds is how can we make sure that this is a competitive process? And the first place to start was we want to make sure that we have an instant payment process, an instant payment project that is widely available and that puts everyone in common ground. So that was the first idea, is how to promote competition. And the first thing is we need to build something that is simple enough so that all financial institutions can use it, that is open to all financial institutions, and that has wide participation. So that was the first idea. And we actually worked on a lot of the things on how to make it friendly. The second is we wanted to be, it needed to be inclusive. So the first thing is it needs to be either cheap or free. So we designed it to be free for individuals and very cheap for companies. So as that, we were very, very much surprised on the amount of new keys that were being registered in the system. I remember in an interview right after launching, someone asked me, what do you think is going to happen in terms of the usage? And I thought, you know, maybe in six months we'll have 20 million people using, but that happened in a week and a half. So I mean, I think that tells us the speed of the process. We now have 114 million people. That's more than almost 70% of the adult population. We have 9 million companies, around 65% of the companies are using. And so I think we achieved the objective of being competitive and being inclusive. One other thing that we wanted to have is to be very transparent. So the question is, how can you be transparent from the very beginning? Well, you need to set up the rules and not change them. So if you start changing pricing, for example, it becomes very difficult for the user to understand, I'm not paying now, I'm going to pay in the future. So it needed to be very clear, you know, individuals don't pay, companies pay, and they pay less than they were paying now for the traditional methods. You needed to be fast and secure. So you needed to see the money right in your account at the same moment. There was a trade-off between being very fast and being very secure. We had a long debate on that. We could have made it much more secure, but then it would take a long time. And so this was taken into consideration. And to end, I think it needs to be forward-looking. You need to be looking at this and saying, okay, I have a platform that is open enough that I can add new features and I can do other things so that people know that this system will be here for a while. So those, I think, are the elements. Thank you, Mr. Shin. Thank you, Governor. I think that's, you know, these numbers are really very impressive. You know, 114 million people, you know, over two-thirds of the adult population, you know, signed up to the system within a space of just over a year. What do you think is the secret to the success? I mean, what were the forces that actually led to this very rapid adoption? And in particular, what role did the central bank play in this very rapid adoption? That's a very good question. In the very beginning, you know, we were talking being liberal economists, you know, why should the central bank be involved in doing that? Why can't just we create conditions for the private sector to do it? And we thought a lot about that. And we thought there are a lot of, you know, steps that need to be taken so that you make sure that this is competitive in the future. And the technology was advancing very fast. We were seeing a lot of vertical chains being created. And we thought that was a good opportunity for the central bank to make sure that this puts a common ground to make sure that we have a competitive landscape in the future. Because the challenge of regulation is really not doing something that works now. It's to create a regulation now that not only ensures competitive elements now, but also ensures that as the system grows, it will become competitive in the future. So it needs to be forward-looking in a way. I think one of the things that I think we're responsible for the success is we wanted to create a brand so that people can recognize. Nobody can use the brand PIX anywhere. The brand can be used alongside the logo of a bank or of any financial institution. But PIX is a brand that belongs to the government. We wanted to create a strong brand with an easy name that people would remember. And we wanted to be very user-friendly. So I'll give you an example. In the very beginning, when we just launched PIX, I was a bit frustrated because the way I saw it and the way I would have designed it if I was in a bank was so to combine the agenda of the cell phone with the keys that we had in the system so that people would be able to automatically download the keys, interact with the agenda of the cell phone, and do a PIX without having to input numbers into the system. But it wasn't done like that in the very beginning. Some banks had some adjustments. But at some point in time, I actually called banks and I said, you know, you can make this a lot better for you. And remember, this is a product that is a common level ground. So if you have it in a much easier, much user-friendly way, you're going to get more customers. So today, almost every bank has now the system that interacts with their agenda. So if you have someone in your agenda, your context, that either has an email or a phone number that is a key, it will be identified automatically. Also, we wanted to be friendly on other dimensions. So we needed to have a QR code process that was standard, that was friendly so that everybody can use. And we wanted to make sure that everybody understood this was a competitive environment. But also, as you go into the product, you need to develop governance. So we needed to be talking to everyone who was involved. We needed the banks to participate. We need to create the governance in which we hear everyone that is involved in the project. We did a lot of things to public consultation to make sure that everybody participated in this. And again, I think one of the keys is being forward-looking. Whenever we talk about designing something, I'm not looking today. I'm looking, how is this going to look three, four years from now? Because the growth is very exponential. So it can become obsolete very fast if you are not designed from the very beginning to add new features or to bend to certain circumstances. So I would say that those are the elements. Absolutely. Let's move to the data architecture of PIX. I think we've seen growing awareness of the importance of privacy. And because we're using real names, there will be actually a great deal of onus on that. The fact that these instant payments can be made at the touch of the screen means that that kind of information transfer also has to be done very fast, but also in a very secure way. So what are the features of PIX that ensure user privacy? And how have the regulations on data privacy influenced the way that you actually roll this out? It's a very good question. Also, thank you. Well, from the very beginning, the challenge was trying to maximize a balance of things. And the equation that we were trying to maximize was, I wanted to be as secure as possible using data that is as little sensitive as possible. So if I can use a system that has data trafficking into the system that's not very sensitive, but at the same time is a secure system, then optimize both. And you need to analyze that. So from the very beginning, the keys are either phone numbers or your digital ID. Today, there's a system that if you go on the internet and you type the number of a person, 85% of the people don't go there to cancel the data. So you automatically get the phone number or the digital ID. So most of the data that is being used to transfer money in PIX is data that's not very sensitive. So the other thing is you need to be very transparent with what's happening. So as contrary to some other countries that only disclose leakage when the data is sensitive, we disclose it 100% of the times. So the other day, there was a data leakage of 2,000 people, which is infimal compared to the number of users. And the data that was leaked was basically the name and the phone number. And we were talking to the press on that. And someone asked me, and I said, do you know what kind of data was leaked? And no. Well, it was the name and the phone number. By the way, if you have a checkbook, open the checkbook and look at what's written in your checkbook. It has your name. It has your phone number. Sometimes it has your digital ID. So the data that is being used is not very sensitive. But you need to be very transparent on that. So we created a lot of systems that have data encryption. It's important to have a non-off system so that once you store, the financial transactions is not exposed to the web environment in a way. So you have the gates that are being closed in terms of storing data and being able to use that. We limit the number of access because a lot of data leakage comes from within. So we limit the access to data. We also try to provide data, even in case of requests from judges or things like that, we only provide the data, understanding that the data that we're providing is not very sensitive. We created rules in terms of abusing the use of data, negligence. So we did a lot of things to make sure that everyone in the system was motivated to be cohesive with the laws that we have. But I think the most important thing is try to maximize what I said in the beginning. If you can do a system, because data leaks happen, they will happen more and more frequently. It's happening to companies every day, it's happening to governments every day. So the main idea is if I can do a system that is very secure and use data that is not very sensitive, then I can optimize that. Thank you. Yes, indeed. I think this is, you know, that's an experience that I think is very much shared by other jurisdictions as well. Now let's move to more the industrial structure, if you like. One of the things that we point out in the bulletin that we've just launched is that, you know, PICS mandated large banks with more than 500,000 users to join PICS. But that meant that, you know, many other smaller banks and, indeed, non-bank payment service providers also joined. So talk to us a bit about how you motivate commercial banks and the non-bank PSPs to, you know, contribute by being at the cutting edge of innovation. That was also a topic that was very much debated. My idea was first, you know, there's nothing I can do to motivate banks. What I need to do is to motivate the clients. Banks are motivated by their clients. So if you can motivate clients, we'll motivate banks. But we need to have a minimal infrastructure and a minimum critical mass so that the system starts working. So we require the 30 biggest banks to enter the system. In the conversations with them, there was a lot of misconception in the beginning. The first misconception that they had was that what you're doing is just substituting what we have now and we charge for, for something that's going to come from the government. And I said, no, I don't think so. I actually think you're going to see increasing the velocity of money. You're going to see a number of transactions that far outweighs what we have today. And I think this growth is going to be exponential. And that's what happened. If you look at the number of transactions with PIX, it's many folds, many times the amount that you had in the past with the other instruments that we used to call TED and DOC. So I think in this process, banks started to understand that, you know, actually this is going to generate new business models. Today you go and you see, for example, people asking for money in the streets and they accept PIX. You go on the beach and you want to buy, you know, things from people who are selling things on the sand and now they accept PIX. So banks started to realize that maybe I'm losing here because I'm not charging for something that I used to charge, but I'm making money in someone else. You created a lot of new business models, people who sell things with very small ticket value that couldn't do it in the past. Now we're doing. They are opening bank accounts. They are consuming banking services on that. You have a lot of people that just opened their accounts just to have PIX. Actually 25% of the people did the first transaction, digital transaction with PIX. So it was important to convince banks that this is not a zero-sum game, that actually the whole system is going to be larger, that you're going to generate inclusiveness and that they're going to have new business models and new clients. So I think this was the main task. There's a lot of other things, but they all come, I think, as accessory. I think this was the main challenge was trying to convince the banks that this was going to happen. I think we did convince banks that this is going to happen. And then all of a sudden, everyone wants to be in the system. And now the banks are actually using the system in their favor because they don't need to carry so much money around, which is one of the largest costs for banks in Brazil. They don't need to have so much security in the system. They're actually using credit. They're doing credit using PIX because now you can program the installments on PIX. So at the end, I think what initially was seen as an instrument that will withdraw revenue from the system is actually adding revenue to the system. Thank you. I think that's a great point. I think that's a lesson for not only other emerging and developing economies, but also many advanced economies, I think, would definitely benefit from that lesson. What I want to do, Governor, is now to look ahead. And maybe we can continue on this theme of how do we actually motivate financial intermediaries also to embrace this greater push towards financial inclusion. I love your point about to motivate banks, you have to motivate the customers. And let me bring in CBDCs in this context. I think one of the arguments you often hear is, well, won't CBDCs simply take away business from the banking sector? And CBDCs, I think, are perhaps also important in another way because the kinds of data architecture that we've talked about, the digital IDs and the application programming interfaces, the APIs, they have a lot in common with the kind of data architecture that we would use for retail CBDCs. Of course, with the difference that with CBDCs, there's a direct claim on the central bank. How do you see CBDCs fitting in your vision for the payment system and the financial system in Brazil over the next few years? That's a topic that I think has motivated a lot of the central banks lately. I remember in the very beginning, it was kind of a long time ago now. In our first meeting talking about CBDCs, I got out of the meeting with a lot of questions, but not a lot of answers. I had a lot of questions without answers. And I thought to myself, being a lover of technology, I love technology, in technology, if you don't have the answers, you can't begin to develop a project because everything, all the rails will fall in place once you have the answers. The first question that I asked myself is, we have PIX, PIX is forward-looking, we can do programmable money into PIX, we can do smart contracts with PIX, so what is it that CBDC is going to bring me that I don't have? We didn't have the answer for this question in the very beginning. It was very difficult. The second question that I asked ourselves is, okay, I am a banking guy and I come from a bank environment. How can I make sure that once you change the liability, the asset liability system, once you choose CBDCs, how can we ensure that this is not going to affect the ability of banks to do leverage on the deposits? And I asked this question around, a lot of people that were more advanced than we were, and I didn't get any answers that I thought was satisfactory. So I went back and in the next meeting, we have a CBDC meeting every month, now we have actually twice a month, and I said, we need to start from answering these questions. So we look into the DeFi space, we look at what I think is happening right now, which is this interaction, I think this is probably what we're going to see growing in the next couple of years, this interaction between monetizing data. I think the world is after monetizing data. We haven't found the way yet, but a lot of companies are building digital wallets. Your savings will be partially the data that you have on yourself. So being able to monetize data will have an interconnection in which how you monetize that. And we thought this interconnection will require something that is more than what we have today. So this is a place for CBDC. The other thing is all this decentralized financing that's happening, and we look at the way it's going, and how you have this decentralized autonomous organization that they're creating financial system within, and I've become very interested in metaverse lately, I've been studying that for a while now, and I see people are not looking at that. I don't remember any of our central bank meetings that anybody has ever mentioned this word. And if you look at the number of financial transactions that are happening in the metaverse, it's much more exponential than we are seeing in crypto, for example, crypto outside alone. So I think you have all these interconnections. I think you need to go and look for standardization, very important, the standardization to make sure that everything falls together. I also think there is an element that people don't look at so much, which is the capacity of reuse protocols. Because once that is in place, and you have a common language, it will make financial innovation much cheaper. You're able to produce financial products in a much cheaper way, because you're going to be able to reuse protocols. I think when you look at today, the main challenge of these platform companies, platform financial companies, is they don't have a lot of new products, because it's very costly for them to launch a product. And the thinking that you can have this universal reusable protocols, I think, would lead to lower even more the barrier of entry on that. So to end, I think I have exceeded my time. The challenge for us now is on the second question, which is how can I do that and make sure that we don't interfere with the ability of banks to give credit. And the way we decided to do was to have a kind of a different system in which the banks are able to issue stable coins on their deposits, and their deposits are guaranteed by the CBDC. So that when you look at M0 and M1, the banks can issue stable coins on the money that they have. And then you actually have a two-layer system that interacts with the layer that we have right now, which is just transactions backed by fiat money. So this is more or less, I don't have a lot of time to explain, but this is more or less where we're going. And I think at the end, the CBDC will interact with liquidity tokens in a way to bring more people into the system. Thank you. Well, that was really illuminating, Governor. Thank you very much for joining us. We could go on for a long time, but we have to make way for the next session. Thank you again. Thank you for the very insightful remarks today. We certainly have learned a lot. So thank you all who joined, and please stay tuned for the next session, which is also going to be on financial inclusion. Thank you, Mr. Xing. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

**Video Transcript:**
> Good morning. My name is Dr. Brad Pragnell, and I'm a consultant with Payments Canada. I would like to welcome you to our session here at the Payments Canada Summit, Real-Time Payment Success Stories, Brazil, India, and Beyond. Real-time payment systems have been implemented in nearly 79 countries, and May 2023 represents 15 years since the launch of UK Faster Payments. What have we learned in those 15 years? What are the challenges that we've addressed in terms of collaboration and commercialization? With us, we've got three noted experts drawn from across the globe. And I would like to start with some introductions. So if each of the panelists can introduce themselves, I would like to start with Carlos Brand. Hi, everyone. Thank you, Brad, for inviting me to the 2023 Payments Canada Summit. It's such a great pleasure to be here and exchange views and experiences with all of you today. Great to share this panel with Stephen May in a way that we can bring perspective from different parts of the globe. My name is Carlos Brand. I'm the head of peak management and operations at the Central Bank of Brazil. I have been dedicated to the development and implementation of our instant payment ecosystem since the very beginning. And I'm currently in charge of peak operations and leading the design of new products and functionalities in peaks. I have been in real-time payments for more than 20 years since implementation of our TGS system in 2002. It's a long but exciting journey with a lot of challenges. Now working with retail payments, we can see the impact of our work in our everyday life, which of course brings a lot of extra motivation for what we do. Thanks again. Thank you, Carlos. And now, Steve. All right. Thanks, Brad. All right. Thanks, Brad. And also, I just want to say how excited I am to be here at the summit and also speaking with May and Carlos. Thank you so much. This is very exciting to see just how many different places in the globe we can get into one panel. So, thanks for doing this, Brad. My name is Steve Haley. I'm the director of market development at the Mojit Foundation. Mojit Foundation manages a real-time retail payments resource base, primarily a code base for an instant payment system that was designed primarily to focus on the interconnection of instant payments between both banks and non-banks, big banks, large mobile money providers, even small microfinance and credit unions to get access to the same system. It's an open-source software, so it allows for countries to have their own sovereign payment system without having a dependency on other countries. But overall, the only things like UPI here, where I live in India, and a number of others, including PIX, have seen massive growth from having very low or zero transaction fees. The problem with that is these are expensive things to run. So, everything that Mojit was built towards was to reduce the cost of deploying, operating, and maintaining an instant payment system so that we can get those retail fees down to as close to zero, if not zero, as possible. My background, I've been working in instant payments and emerging markets for about 15 years, primarily in emerging markets, from nonprofits and mobile money. And working for a large mobile money company, I came across the problem of we just couldn't grow without interoperability, and we didn't have a seat at the table when the banks were deciding what the country was going to look like. And when we weren't actually invited because we were the biggest player, it wasn't good enough because there were a lot more banks than there were of us. And so, what we really focus on is how do we make sure that that table includes everyone, and that the solution that's designed for is built not just for mobile money and other financial institutions to be an add-on, but primary participants. Thanks. Great. Thank you very much, Steve. And May, could you introduce yourself and give us a little bit of background about your role at AP+. Sure. Thanks, Brad. Thanks again for having me, and also along with Steve and Carlos. So, very excited to be here. So, hi, everyone. I'm May Lam. I'm the Chief Information Officer at Australian Payment Plus. AP Plus is just over a year old, and we bring together Australia's three domestic payment providers, BPAY Group, AFPOS, and BP Australia into one integrated entity. Our capabilities include Australian domestic debit network, real-time payment infrastructure, secure bill payment, digital identity exchange, QR code payment, wallet-as-a-service solutions, and open payment experiences. So, this amalgamation enabled AP Plus to be uniquely placed to create a more competitive and coordinated entity that is strategically placed to respond to the impacts of the regulatory and technological change today into the future. Prior to joining AP Plus, I was a partner at EY, where I led the payment practice for Asia-Pacific and fintech practice for Oceania. I'm a payment software engineer by trade and have been having the joy of payment ecosystem for the last 20 years. Great. Thank you very much, May. And I might actually start with you. So, Australia introduced the new payments platform back in 2018. It was offered through an industry consortium. And can you provide us maybe with a little bit of background around the new payments platform's development and growth, and particularly in the period since its launch in early 2018 to now? Yeah, sure. Thank you. So, the new payments platform, MPP, is Australian real-time payment infrastructure. It was designed to be a more modern payment system that will deliver speed, be always available 24 times seven, and have the ability to leverage the ISO 20022 messaging format to include rich data beyond payment instructions. It also offers a simpler addressing service via what we call the pay ID alias, which links to an easy-to-remember piece of information, like a mobile phone number or email address. It was definitely a collaborative achievement, which I'm sure that we will unpack further about that, where an industry consortium of financial institutions came together to develop it together. So, five years on since the launch, the MPP accounts for one in three account-to-account payments in Australia, which is over 88 million accounts, and we have the vast majority of financial institutions, both large and small, and an increasing growing number of fintechs participating in MPP. MPP started off being used as a simple push payment, mainly for P2P payments, but has now grown to cover a wide range of risk cases, including merchant disbursements, travel insurance trading, payroll, rental payments, share trading, and also of different money transfers. What also through COVID we see more is that through that, it's been a growing number of small businesses, from trade people, hairdressers, restaurants, to business selling online and marketplaces. It was also used to assess scale by our government welfare agency during the pandemic to provide relief payments into the hands of citizens immediately, even over the weekends. Some of the key stats today, so the platform, probably compared to Brazil or India, is not big, but for Australia it's quite big, so we are quite proud of that. So as a platform, now it does 3.5 million transactions a day, valued at $4 billion a day, and in a year it's about 1.2 billion transactions, and our single largest transaction was for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-81z6Su8pY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-81z6Su8pY) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-81z6Su8pY&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
9.8 billion. We are seeing the growing of the PayID, the use cases are actually beyond our expectation, and we now have over 14 million PayID registers, which is about, at our population, around 20.7 million, and approximately 20% of the MPP payments are being made by PayID, and people started using the PayID, they have a very strong tendency to continue to use it, and 47% of the users are saying that they use it at least on a weekly basis, if not daily. And one of the key benefits of the PayID is that you can get a confirmation of the person that you're paying before completing the payment transaction. This has helped reduce the mistaken payments, but also

**Video Transcript:**
> So, when Rahul said a lot of things happen here, it's because Digital Public Infrastructure journey, much of that work, takes a decade. It takes a decade to build an infrastructure game, quite like physical infrastructure. It's long, persistent, across political parties, you have to navigate multiple leaderships, multiple bureaucratic leaderships, whether it's METI or whether it's in PMO or wherever, and actually keep pulling it off, keep making it happen. But what we are seeing is that I think India has mastered the playbook, the way of thinking, and that is what really we brought together last year under G20. By the way, it's not only India that is doing it. Brazil is doing it, Thailand is doing it, a few of these pieces of the puzzle. Especially payment. Payment and ID are very common things that you would see other countries trying to do, because it makes sense to do for them. But it's not obvious that any other country has actually a systematic playbook that has created repeating the same approach. DPI is not one thing. DPI is not a thing you can buy. DPI is a way of thinking. It's a way of approaching the problem statement, large, complex, multi-dimensionally complex problem statement, and trying to figure out what is that we can do at the core that allows that problem to eventually get resolved. And most importantly, when we did DPI, DPIs were always seen. Even today, our infrastructure, Aadhaar or UPI or DG Locker, must be seen only as a necessary condition and not sufficient. It's not sufficient to solve problems. Much more to do. And as you go through, you are in the thick of it. And while IFS, you might not be that much into it, but the rest of your counterparts who are in IAS and IRS and so on, they'll go through this journey. Where problem statements continue to pile up for India, these are complex. For example, access to primary care, we are horribly behind. Access to justice, terribly behind. In other countries, much to do. Going to court is like a denial of service attack, DOS attack, as technologists call it. You know, I'll take you to court. So it's important that India looks at these investments and you should have a mental model. When you say invest in infrastructure, it is similar to saying invest in the highway and the economic benefit of the highway will be reaped over time. Provided your countries have a, you're opening up the businesses, your leadership is not going down the drain. You know, many, many things have to happen for economic boom to happen, right? But it's a necessary condition. Ask the reverse question. What if you did not have the highway? Can you afford not to have the electricity grids? Can you afford not to have the highways? Can you afford not to invest in mobile connectivity? But would that solve people's problem? Not at all. Remember, that's point number one. DPIs don't solve. They are necessary conditions that we must do and that, what we call, it distributes the ability to solve later for us. Very, very key important part. Because lot of times we tend to try to solve a problem. But India has taken a slightly different approach. We said, no, let's look at long term and let's invest in the underlying building blocks, Lego blocks, that are infrastructure in nature that can subsequently come in handy to be able to solve more complex problem when these building blocks come together. Literally, a couple of months ago, a reporter said, now it's 2009, 15 years, 14 years, later, 15 years later, have we solved India's problem? Is it mad? We are not going to solve India's problem that easily. We are like the center of all the problems in the world. And with scale of 1.4 billion most populous nation on earth, we are going to have a lot of problem for a long time to come. But we need a method to the madness. We need a method to address this systematically and not a point solution. You can't force a doctor and a hospital to be created in the villages, 700,000 villages. We are not going to have doctors and so how do you get primary care? But we ask the same question. In 2014, we asked the same question. If banks are not going to go, banks are not going to go, why? How much ever number of force you can put, even with our public sector bank, it's only so much they can do. Why? It's not economically viable at all to start a branch to force officers go and live there, bank, because their children want to be in good schools. They want to be closer to tier one, tier two places. So they don't go. Banks don't start because it's not economically viable to open a bank branch. But remember 2023, when we look back, what did we solve? We still see banks have not gone, but banking has gone. We never managed to get banks to villages. We managed to get banking to villages. So we are now addressing the verbs and not the nouns. There's a distinct difference in that. There's a difference in that thinking because suddenly it opens a possibility in our mind. The old ways of forcing an institution to go there may not be needed in the digital realm. If we are able to actually stretch ourselves digitally and provide e-consult, like teleconsulting, telemedicine, could we give telemedicine? Could we doctor be here but actually still care with our ASHA worker in the front? Sure, we could do that. But then you start asking other questions. But where does the medicine supply come from? Where does the equipment supply come from? You keep unbundling, keep unbundling these problem statements and ask this question all the time. Why is it important to ask that question? The only way to solve something at scale, at scale, India scale and diversity, India scale and diversity is to unbundle these problem statements and ask what is the commonality among these problem statement and see whether we can create, extract that and create a highway or the commonality as a reusable building block, infrastructure, whatever you want to call, right, reusable element. If that reuse, many, many such reusable element comes up, it's like the Lego box with different pieces of puzzle. Now suddenly a health tech company or even a government, private or public, innovators can innovate on top of it. I'll give you an example before we jump into specific. Zaroda. Heard Zaroda? Okay. SEBI, when 2015, SEBI, our regulator, capital market regulator, was analyzing why do we have in India, why do we have only 22 million people participate in capital market? Why are we not getting more people? We have one of the most well regulated mutual fund system in the world. Very well regulated. Why are everybody on the roadside investing in secondary and unregulated, chit funds and non-chit funds and roadside investment, everything informal, right? They live in a completely informal world. We all live in the formal world. Formal banking, formal mutual fund, formal insurance and everything informal for bulk of India. We ask this question. SEBI was asking this question. Why are we having so much difficulty in getting beyond 22 million? The magic number, by the way, is 20, 25 million. You know how many credit cards in 2016 we had? 22 million. You know how many edtech, all edtech, including when Baiju's at the good times, put together we have reached 20 million users. All the health tech put together, 20 million or 18 million. We see this, we're hitting on the big wall, the wall beyond which it's non-economically viable to go after to the rest of the India. You are unable to penetrate and provide the services beyond that. Zero the, this SEBI analyzed this and asked this question. Very very interestingly, not all can be solved, many reasons, habits, people around have habits to invest in mutual funds. Most people don't even have money to invest in mutual funds. Forget it, right? So it is important to ask many questions. One such question was about cost. So SEBI asked this question. What is the cost of signing up a customer if Zerodha is a distributor, Zerodha is known as a distributor, right? Mutual fund distributor, broker, they have broker license, they have distribution license. So they can actually say go sell mutual funds, mutual funds themselves don't sell. It was 1500 rupees. Is the cost of KYC, know your customer, signing up forms, filling up the form, getting the form from the customer, keeping it and simply acquiring a customer. For a broker cost of 1500. How much commission a broker gets? 50 bips, 0.5 percentage. That means if you sell, you know, 100 rupees, I get 50 paisa as a selling commission as a broker. So to recover 1500 rupees, because that's my cost to sign you up, to recover 1500 rupees, I need my customer to write a 3 lakh cheque, 300,000 rupees cheque. Because if you don't write 3 lakh cheque, 50 bips, 0.5 percentage is 1500, I can barely cut over. My cost can be covered only, how many people can write 3 lakh cheque in the country? 22 million people. It was amazing. That eye opening thing, wow. See, the moment that study was done, SEBI said, okay, let's come up with a new KYC policy intervention. By then we had Aadhaar eKYC. What did Aadhaar eKYC do? Aadhaar eKYC converted physical KYC into physical paper KYC and dramatically collapsed the cost. So today, SEBI's KYC cost is less than 20 rupees. That is from 20 dollars to 20 cents. 1500 rupees to 15 rupees. Cost reduction. What does it mean? Zero the. And he publicly acknowledges this every time. Nitin Kamat says as a founder, first 6 years, using paperwork, I could only acquire 60,000 customers. In the next one year, he acquired 6 million customers. Because as a startup, now you as officers is unblocking my way through policies and reusable building blocks like eKYC you can use. eSign, you can use. I mean, no more paper. DC Local, yes, you can use. UPI, of course, you can use. Moment SEBI said under 50,000, they started with 50,000. Under 50,000 KYC, you don't need KYC. Now it's actually 1 lakh, I think, 1 lakh rupees or 2 lakh rupees. Below that investment, if you are investing crores, you still need the paperwork KYC, okay? But that's rich people, very few people. That's 22 million people. They had already taken care. Expanded. This is why our SIP investment, systematic investment, digital, paperless investment has exploded. This is great. Because now suddenly we have a massive what's called expansion of the pie. The formalization of our economy is going beyond the top 50, 60 million people. In 2016, UPI, before UPI, 2016, we had less than 50 million people doing digital payments out of 1 billion adults, 950 million adults at that time, rough count, and 1.3 billion then population, now 1.4, 50 million. Same Paytm, you know how much Paytm, Paytm karo ads and all that thing was going on at that time, right? Paytm brought QR code payments to India, actually, if you look at it, but only within the closed loop system. 50 million. That's what the word was. In six years, take a guess, what's the number right now? How many people do digital payments from 50 million in 2016, in 2023, seven years? 500 million. 500 million. Roughly about 500 million. 10x growth in six years. No country has ever shown the investment in one tiny thing called UPI. It's actually a tiny thing, UPI, by the way. Really tiny thing. Actually, I can tell you, it's really small, but one intervention and one policy intervention from RBI to allow it, to allow fintechs to play, created that what's called a domino effect, exponential change that in the society we are seeing. So you, what we're realizing is that digital public infrastructure investments India made is not about specific technology. It is not about somehow exporting our software. It is exporting our thinking. When you are in front of countries, you would be asked, what actually happened in this country? Don't tell me UPI can be used here or UPI can be used in other countries. But they can also build their own UPI version. That's not the point. If you can get our good products there, congratulations to you because that's a good diplomacy. Definitely, it's a good diplomacy to get it. But it's a way of thinking. You will be in front of every conversation, diplomatic conversation, will start and end. You have no way to create diplomatic pathways or trade gateways or payment opening up between countries without digital underlying. Digital is a way to achieve what you want to achieve. It's not separated anymore from functionality here and digital guys here. It's no more. It is important that you really internalize this idea. And UPI was that idea that began literally here in this building. Fastag began about the floor above. Every one of us effort literally with two or three people thinking about it. UPI began in 2013, 2014 we were writing it and 2015 we piloted it. Literally three people with NPCI, National Payment Corporation of India is our partner. Why is it simple? You know what is the investment we have made as an India? Now that's another question. A lot of people ask, a lot of countries. I engage a lot of countries by the way as part of either MEA invited sessions, G20 invited or otherwise independently. Most questions are revolving around India can manage to do. Why? India is large. India has a lot of techies and India has some money relatively. We have money to invest. All three are wrong. All three assumptions are wrong. Why is it wrong? Do you know what is the spend India has made in digital infrastructure? Aadhaar plus DigiLocker plus eSign plus account aggregator which Siddharth will talk about later plus ONDC plus UPI all put together. How much tax payers money has been spent? How many? 50. Okay. Any other number? She is saying 50. 50 crore for DigiLocker. 50 crore. Okay. Yeah. 50 crore for DigiLocker. You said? 50 crore. No. 50 crore is really. Yeah. So we spend 2 billion dollars. Which is 15, 16 thousand crores. 16 thousand crores over the last 15 years. Okay. This is not spent every year. Okay. From 2009 then 2014 we up the ante with Digital India. 2009 to 2014 we only had Aadhaar. Then Digital India came in 2015 we launched and we launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign.

We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. We launched eSign. But it is actually not a money game. So second argument is that India has a lot of tech talent. Interestingly, we don't need tech talent. What was the size of Aadhaar team? 150 people, entire organization. 150 people, tech organization, including our outsourced software partner, 40 on an average and actual tech internal team about 5. And we had 40,000 stations and 200,000 operators in the country. In 7 years, we gave 1 billion IDs with 150 people in your counterparts, your senior officials. That means a small organization with a small amount of investment, if only we leverage the ecosystem, banking, CSCs, and all the ecosystem we have and which we can leverage, which is what UPI we see. If you leverage the ecosystem, NPCA doesn't have to do the hard work. Ecosystem does the hard work. And costs get distributed. Phone pay is OK to take the cost of going and sticking all the QR codes because they have a market valuation and market expansion game. Perfect. Why should government go do all that thing, right? So UPI is an example. And yesterday, somebody was asking, so how long did it take you to do UPI design? It took a year for us to distill the UPI design. And the UPI design was literally 1 and 1 half pages. 1.5 pages. That was UPI design. That created, last month we ended up with 12.5 billion transactions. 12.5 billion transactions is equivalent to MasterCard volume worldwide. UPI, right? So how did we achieve? It's not because NPCA or a finance ministry went and did all these things. It's because we bootstrapped a new playground, created a new ecosystem altogether. Phone pay didn't exist. In fact, I remember Rahul and Samir showing up in this room, that side room, and literally out of Flipkart and saying, we are looking at a FinTech company. We said, OK, we have something called UPI coming up. Do you want to play the game? And they played the game. Beautiful. They executed very well. It's fantastic to see they executed. Kudos to them. Entrepreneurial energy is not that we did it, they did it. But you create a new playground. And we are, with ONDC, a thousand plus, and Sujith is here to talk about the protocol behind it, and we have 40 plus projects around the world. Thousand plus startups are being funded on a new playground called ONDC. So what is it happening? What is government doing? Three, these three things. First, invest in what's called a minimum infrastructure. Invest not much money, but think through it, invest it. What does it do? It unblocks some common friction among everybody. It creates a reusable thing and unblocks it. Then create a policy around governing that UPI. Governing was important because it's money. Last year, we moved two trillion US dollars on UPI. That's a lot of money. So people can't say, oh, I lost it, or I don't know when I'll get back, or all that thing, right? It's money. So people are very, very careful. Governance of DPI is very key. It's like saying, I built the road, we have no rules. No, can't do. You have to have rules on the game. OK, so you create the rules. But real value, economic value, will come when you unleash market innovation. And you will be asked this question repeatedly, what's the story of DPI? DPI is not story of one particular tech. It's not one particular win. It's a way of thinking India is doing this repeatedly, saying, create the minimum building block, create governance around it, and activate a market. And we can do this repeatedly. In commerce, I don't know whether anybody from Bangalore, you will see Nama Yatri and mobility travel, auto rickshaws and all that thing here. So completely decentralized, and we are moving towards a very different architecture. We'll talk about that later. So I think what is the real takeaway? Takeaway is that much of this, we have seen it before. Funny thing. Funny thing. We have seen it before. Where have you seen this before? What ride is not an infrastructure play. Tell me a digital infrastructure on top of which lot of innovation and the whole world changed. CoWin was an app story, less of an infrastructure story. Internet itself. Google is a solution provider. So there's a difference between who builds a highway and who runs the private bus. Think of that way. Android is a great example, but it's a private-ish rail. It's open source, but it's quasi. They do have some control over the open source distribution. So nevertheless, they did a good job, because if you're left with only iPhone, it would have been tough for us. Smartphone wouldn't have penetrated. Android really created it. Difference between... Okay, now it's a good question. What's the difference between open source Linux and UPI? Linux is merely a passive asset. It's lying there. When you apply Linux, use Linux somewhere, it becomes a DPI. The other part is called DPG. You would have heard that word, digital public goods. Linux is a classic example of a digital public good, open source, lying in. It's useful, because I can reuse that. But when you actually, what's called deploy, when you use that in some environment to create an infrastructure, it becomes DPI. Internet is a classic example of it. GSM is a classic example. By the way, there's a reason why you can pick up a phone and call your counterpart in France or your senior in France. Completely different machines, different SIM cards, different telco, different operating system, but voice travels seamlessly back and forth. How did it happen? It's not because Airtel and everybody sat to, wrote in one app. Because somebody built something called a GSM protocol and a consortium, GSMA, alliance came together to say, if you don't create interoperability, at humanity's scale, we can't deploy this. Everybody will create a WhatsApp like, closed loop, Airtel can only call Airtel, Airtel can only call Airtel, Vodafone can only Vodafone. What's the use? It would have been like a WhatsApp story. Today, WhatsApp and Signal and Telegram and iMessage are all not interoperable. Europe is trying to make it interoperable. Maybe we are late a little bit, unfortunately. RCS is a way to approach that. Very good. RCS is one open standard proposed to deal with that interoperability of messaging. But emails we can. I can send from my Google mail to your Yahoo mail and so on. So pre-internet, until 99 or so, 2000, we did all the right things. And boom. And after that, it was all private tech players running away. Because government and standards organization could not go at the speed of the private industry. Private industry, if I were building private industry, if you were building a private company, I will create more. As much more as possible so that you won't escape me. Why not? You know, that's my private company. Everybody wants to be in WhatsApp, WhatsApp, WhatsApp, WhatsApp and so on. No big deal. But what is the story we are doing is that such closed loop systems have demonstrated it's not scalable to a large population and it creates monopoly risk, which even US is discussing today. Forget Europe. Europe is big time discussing. Everybody other than US, because they're all US companies, right? Whether it's Uber or WhatsApp or Airbnb, everybody, Meta, everybody is US company. So other than US companies, everybody is discussing this. Now why is another requirement of DPI? Another key requirement of DPI is sovereignty. Why is it a topic? I mean, when the war broke out in Ukraine, almost instantly, MasterCard and Visa decided to shut off payment in Russia. We are not arguing geopolitically correct or wrong. Okay, that's not the argument we are here for. It's a question that your national critical infrastructure that your society depends on, because without it you can't live digitally, if they start getting hostage and a kill switch is somewhere remote, you have a problem. Get used to it. You do have a problem. So we are, as diplomats, we are actually telling many countries, you need to think about two reasons why you need DPIs. Even developed nations, developing nations, global south, they will happily somewhat relate to India. Same problem, same mess, same complexities. So they'll say, yeah, we see Brazil, Argentina, Peru, we'll see similar behavior. Global north, though, the developing nations somehow think DPI is not needed. But our real argument, even there, which many European nations are starting to realize is twofold. One, how do you create, ensure national critical digital infrastructure? National critical infrastructure has you as your sovereign control over the infrastructure. Point number two, how do we make sure, how do you, as country or a policy maker, make sure that your startup, your local innovation ecosystem has any chance of playing the game? Otherwise you are keeping quiet, right? You are saying whatever. It's almost in the form of digital colonization. In fact, it was used publicly in Washington a year and a half ago in front of everybody. An African leader stood up and said, it is repeating. You are repeating digital colonization. Because I have no control. I have no idea as a policy maker. So these are very important decisions that you will be trusted upon. So our DPI has actually demonstrated not only our own benefit. Of course, India is formalizing our economy from 50 million to 500 million. Now Aishwarya Mandir has reached 400 plus million people with health insurance and hopefully health and so on. Diksha has reached 200 million children under MOE. By the way, Diksha infrastructure with this extra foundation was actually helping build, and of course, Aadhaar has reached a billion people. So we have demonstrated for our own benefit that we have done. But we have also demonstrated that there is a method in our approach that allows long-term view of the playground. And you can invest in infrastructure. It does not cost much. And if you invest in infrastructure and create interoperability and fair market competition, then you can deal with monopolies or sovereignty issues and most importantly, local innovation, entrepreneurial innovation. And that is what is resonating whether we are in Paris or whether we are in any of the countries that we constantly travel to, even in Washington, interestingly. Not in the valley, but definitely in Washington. And you will be part of those discussions sooner or later. Thank you. Thank you so much.
