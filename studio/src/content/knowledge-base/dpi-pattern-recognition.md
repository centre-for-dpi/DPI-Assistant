# DPI Pattern Recognition and Building Block Recommendations

## Market Access Patterns

When users mention **market access** or related concepts, this is a strong signal to recommend **open networks** as a DPI building block. Open networks enable interoperable, decentralized marketplaces that connect multiple participants without central intermediaries.

### Key Signals for Open Networks:
- "want access to markets"
- "connecting buyers and sellers"
- "marketplace integration"
- "vendor discovery"
- "price discovery"
- "multi-sided markets"
- "e-commerce integration"
- "empower small sellers'
- "supply chain connectivity"

### Open Networks Use Cases (examples, not exhauastive):
1. **Agriculture**: Connecting farmers directly to buyers, input suppliers, and logistics providers
2. **Commerce**: Enabling interoperable e-commerce across multiple platforms
3. **Mobility**: Connecting transportation providers with users across different apps
4. **Healthcare**: Connecting patients with healthcare providers, labs, and pharmacies
5. **Education**: Connecting learners with education providers and content creators

### Implementation Approach:
When market access is mentioned, consider recommending:
1. **Open Network Protocols** (like Beckn) for decentralized commerce
2. **Digital Identity** for participant verification
3. **Digital Payments** for seamless transactions
4. **Data Sharing Platforms** for market information exchange
5. **Registries** for tracking participants and their offerings
